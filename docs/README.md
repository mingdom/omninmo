# Stock Prediction System Documentation

## Documentation Philosophy

Our documentation is organized into three main categories, each serving a distinct purpose:
Note: Always include a DATE on every plan so we know when it was last updated.

1. **Current Implementation** (top-level docs)
   - Up-to-date documentation of the current system
   - Single source of truth for implemented features
   - Reference for understanding the codebase

2. **Development Plans** (`devplan/`)
   - Future improvements and proposals
   - Design documents for upcoming features
   - Historical plans and migration guides
   - May not reflect current implementation

3. **Implementation Progress** (`devlog/`)
   - Daily development notes
   - Implementation details and decisions
   - Progress tracking and milestones
   - Historical context for changes
