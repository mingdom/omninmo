# System Architecture

## Overview
The stock prediction system uses XGBoost regression to predict future stock returns. The system is designed to be modular, maintainable, and efficient.

## Components

### 1. Data Pipeline
- Data fetching and caching with configurable TTL (time-to-live)
- Support for real API data and synthetic sample data generation
- Price history processing with flexible time periods and intervals
- Feature engineering with technical indicators and risk metrics
- Market data integration for comparative analysis
- Data validation and error handling

### 2. Model Core
- XGBoost regressor with configurable hyperparameters
- Feature preprocessing and normalization
- Return prediction with confidence scoring
- Rating conversion with configurable thresholds
- Feature importance analysis and stability metrics

### 3. Training Pipeline
- K-fold cross-validation with performance metrics
- Model training with randomized seeds for robustness
- Comprehensive performance evaluation (RMSE, MAE, RÂ²)
- Feature importance analysis with visualization support
- MLflow integration for experiment tracking

### 4. Prediction Service
- Real-time predictions with confidence scores
- Score normalization with historical context
- Rating generation with market comparison
- Risk-adjusted performance metrics
- Enhanced features for market sensitivity

## Key Features
- Efficient data caching with configurable expiration
- Robust error handling with custom exception types
- Comprehensive logging at multiple levels
- Performance monitoring and visualization
- Support for both risk-adjusted and absolute return targets
- Configuration via hierarchical YAML files

## Configuration
All major parameters are defined in the configuration system:
- Model parameters (learning rate, depth, estimators)
- Training settings (periods, intervals, cross-validation)
- Rating thresholds and confidence levels
- Data settings (caching, periods, API configuration)
- Feature engineering thresholds and parameters

## Performance
- Optimized for speed with NumPy and Pandas vectorization
- Memory-efficient processing with garbage collection
- Scalable design supporting varying data volumes
- Robust error handling with graceful degradation

## Future Enhancements
- Enhanced feature engineering with alternative data sources
- Improved risk metrics with factor modeling
- Better confidence estimation with uncertainty quantification
- Advanced monitoring with real-time alerting
- Ensemble models for improved prediction accuracy
