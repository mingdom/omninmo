# Stock Prediction System Architecture

## System Overview

The stock prediction system is designed to provide reliable predictions for stock price movements using machine learning. The system emphasizes reliability, maintainability, and performance through careful architectural decisions.

## Core Components

### 1. Data Pipeline
- **DataFetcher** (`data_fetcher.py`)
  - Responsible for retrieving historical stock data
  - Supports both live API data and sample data for testing
  - Implements caching to minimize API calls
  - Handles data validation and cleaning

- **Features** (`features.py`)
  - Generates technical indicators and features
  - Ensures numerical stability through proper data type handling
  - Modular design allows easy addition of new features

### 2. Model Infrastructure
- **Predictor** (`predictor.py`)
  - Core XGBoost model implementation
  - Supports both regression and classification modes
  - Implements comprehensive cross-validation
  - Handles feature importance analysis
  - Memory-optimized data processing

- **Training Pipeline** (`train.py`)
  - Orchestrates the training process
  - Handles data preprocessing and validation
  - Manages model persistence and analysis outputs

### 3. Configuration & Logging
- **Config** (`config.py`)
  - Centralized configuration management
  - YAML-based configuration for flexibility
  - Supports environment-specific settings

- **Logging**
  - Comprehensive logging throughout the system
  - Separate log files for training and prediction
  - Detailed error tracking in `deverrors.md`

## Key Architectural Decisions

### 1. Mandatory Cross-Validation
**Decision**: Always use k-fold cross-validation during training.

**Rationale**:
- More reliable performance estimates
- Early detection of overfitting
- Better understanding of model stability
- Essential for financial applications where reliability is critical

**Implementation**:
- 5-fold cross-validation by default
- Feature importance stability analysis across folds
- Variance monitoring between folds
- Final model trained on full dataset after validation

### 2. Memory Optimization
**Decision**: Implement memory-efficient data processing.

**Rationale**:
- Support for large datasets
- Reduced memory footprint
- Faster training times

**Implementation**:
- Use of float32 data types
- NumPy arrays for data splitting
- Efficient feature importance calculation
- Memory cleanup after each fold

### 3. Error Handling & Validation
**Decision**: Implement comprehensive error handling and data validation.

**Rationale**:
- Early detection of data issues
- Prevent silent failures
- Maintain data quality

**Implementation**:
- Input validation for all components
- Explicit error messages and logging
- Automatic data type conversion when safe
- Validation of feature engineering outputs

### 4. Console-First Design
**Decision**: Focus on command-line interface rather than web UI.

**Rationale**:
- Simplifies deployment
- Better for automation and scripting
- Reduced complexity
- Easier testing and debugging

**Implementation**:
- Command-line arguments for all operations
- Structured output formats
- Comprehensive logging
- Configuration via YAML files

## Data Flow

1. **Data Ingestion**
   ```
   API/Sample Data → DataFetcher → Cached Raw Data
   ```

2. **Feature Engineering**
   ```
   Raw Data → Features → Technical Indicators → Feature Matrix
   ```

3. **Model Training**
   ```
   Feature Matrix → Cross-Validation → Performance Analysis → Final Model
   ```

4. **Prediction**
   ```
   New Data → Feature Engineering → Model Prediction → Results
   ```
