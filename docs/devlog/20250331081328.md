# Fixed NoneType Formatting Errors in Position Details

## Issue
When loading the portfolio dashboard with a CSV file and then clicking on the Details button, the application displayed an error:
```
TypeError: unsupported format string passed to NoneType.__format__
```

The error occurred in `create_stock_section()` when trying to format `stock.quantity` with a comma separator using `f"{stock.quantity:,}"`. This indicates that `stock.quantity` or other attributes were `None`, but the code was trying to apply string formatting to them.

## Root Cause
The Position and OptionPosition objects could have None values for certain attributes (quantity, market_value, beta, etc.), but the code wasn't checking for None before applying string formatting. This caused TypeError exceptions when trying to apply formatting to None values.

## Solution
1. Added null checks throughout `position_details.py` for all values that might be None:
   - In `create_stock_section()`, added checks like:
     ```python
     html.Span(f"{stock.quantity:,}" if stock.quantity is not None else "N/A")
     ```

   - In `create_options_section()`, added similar checks for option attributes:
     ```python
     html.Td(f"${opt.strike:,.2f}" if opt.strike is not None else "N/A")
     ```

   - In `create_combined_metrics()`, added checks for the combined metrics:
     ```python
     format_currency(group.net_exposure) if group.net_exposure is not None else "N/A"
     ```

2. Fixed the sorting key lambda function to handle None values:
   ```python
   sorted(options, key=lambda x: (x.option_type or "", x.strike or 0))
   ```

3. Added a fallback for None expiry dates:
   ```python
   expiry_str = opt.expiry if opt.expiry is not None else "Unknown"
   ```

## Result
The position details modal now properly handles None values in position attributes. Instead of throwing errors, it displays "N/A" for any missing values, allowing users to still view the available information without application crashes.

This fix makes the application more robust against incomplete or varied data in the portfolio CSV file.
