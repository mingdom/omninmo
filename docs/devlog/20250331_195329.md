# Options Calculation Improvement Needs

## Overview

After examining the option calculations in the folio package, I've identified several areas that need improvement. The current implementation uses overly simplistic models for options pricing, Greeks calculations, and portfolio risk assessment.

## Current Implementation Issues

1. **Simplistic Delta Calculation**: The code uses a `calculate_simple_delta` function that does not incorporate the full Black-Scholes model or account for factors like implied volatility.

2. **Limited Greeks**: Only delta is calculated and used for exposure calculations. Missing key Greeks like gamma, theta, and vega.

3. **Brittle Option Detection**: The `is_option_desc` function uses a rigid pattern match that only works for one specific option description format.

4. **Simplistic Exposure Classification**: Options are classified as "long" or "short" based only on option type and quantity, ignoring moneyness and other factors.

5. **Missing Risk Metrics**: No calculation for portfolio-level gamma, vega, or theta exposures, which are critical for proper risk management.

## Added TODOs

1. **Option Delta Calculation**:
   - Replace simple delta calculation with proper Black-Scholes model
   - Account for implied volatility, time to expiration, and interest rates
   - Consider using specialized libraries like py_vollib or mibian

2. **Additional Greeks**:
   - Add gamma, theta, vega calculation to individual option positions
   - Add these metrics to the OptionPosition class and corresponding dictionary types
   - Display these values in the UI for better risk assessment

3. **Option Description Detection**:
   - Improve parsing to handle weekly options, non-standard date formats, LEAPS
   - Make pattern matching more flexible and robust

4. **Portfolio Summary Enhancements**:
   - Add implied volatility exposure tracking (vega)
   - Add time decay exposure metrics (theta)
   - Implement portfolio gamma calculations
   - Add scenario analysis for different market movements
   - Develop stress testing for extreme market conditions

5. **Exposure Classification**:
   - Consider option moneyness when classifying exposure
   - Account for implied volatility and time to expiration
   - Track exposures separately by expiration timeframes

## Next Steps

The highest priority items are:
1. Implementing proper Black-Scholes delta calculation
2. Adding the remaining Greeks to the data model
3. Improving the portfolio summary calculations to incorporate these metrics

These changes will significantly improve the accuracy of risk metrics and provide traders with more comprehensive information for decision-making.
