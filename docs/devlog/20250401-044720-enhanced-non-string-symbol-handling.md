# Enhanced Non-String Symbol Handling and Investigation

## Summary

Enhanced the logging for non-string symbols in portfolio data to better understand their origin and nature. The original fix correctly handled the `AttributeError` by converting non-string symbols to strings, but we've now added more comprehensive logging to help diagnose the root cause of these non-string symbols.

## Investigation Findings

1. **Current Portfolio Data**: Analysis of the `portfolio.csv` file showed that all symbols in the current dataset are already strings. This suggests that non-string symbols may be introduced through other data sources or through data manipulation before reaching `process_portfolio_data`.

2. **Simulated Test Case**: We created a test with various non-string symbol types:
   - Float numbers (123.45)
   - NaN values (float('nan'))
   - None values

   The enhanced logging successfully identified and reported each of these types.

3. **Source of Non-String Symbols**: The most likely sources include:
   - CSV files with missing values that pandas converts to NaN
   - DataFrame transformations or joins that introduce NaN or None values
   - Numeric IDs being used as symbols in some data sources
   - Non-string symbols that are introduced during integration with other systems

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Logging**: Updated the non-string symbol detection to log more details:
   ```python
   logger.warning(
       f"Non-string symbol detected (row {index}): {repr(symbol)} (type: {type(symbol).__name__}), "
       f"Description: '{row.get('Description', 'N/A')}', Type: '{row.get('Type', 'N/A')}'"
   )
   ```

   This provides:
   - The row index for easier identification
   - The raw symbol value using repr() for accurate representation
   - The Python type name
   - Associated description and type for context

2. **Warning Level**: Changed the log level from debug to warning to ensure these events are more visible, as they might indicate data quality issues.

## Best Practices

This enhancement follows our established best practices:

1. **Defensive Programming**: We maintain the type checking before string operations while adding better visibility.
2. **Improved Diagnostics**: The enhanced logging provides more context for troubleshooting.
3. **Data Quality Monitoring**: Warnings about unexpected data types help identify potential upstream data issues.
4. **Forward Compatibility**: We continue to handle all symbol types gracefully, preventing crashes while providing alerts.

## Recommendations

1. **Monitor Logs**: Keep an eye on these warnings in production to identify potential data quality issues.
2. **Data Validation**: Consider adding validation steps earlier in the data pipeline to ensure symbols are strings before reaching `process_portfolio_data`.
3. **Documentation**: Update data requirements documentation to specify that Symbol values should be strings.
