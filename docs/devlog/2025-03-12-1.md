# 2024-03-21: MLflow and Pandas Warning Fixes

## Changes Made
1. Fixed MLflow integer column warnings by explicitly converting integer columns to float64
2. Fixed pandas SettingWithCopyWarning by:
   - Creating explicit copy of input data with `.copy()`
   - Using `.loc` accessor for DataFrame assignments

## Impact
- More robust handling of missing values in MLflow model logging
- Cleaner code that follows pandas best practices
- Eliminated warning messages during model training

## Files Modified
- `src/v2/training_summary.py`
