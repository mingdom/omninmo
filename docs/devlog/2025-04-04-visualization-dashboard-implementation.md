# Devlog: Visualization Dashboard Implementation

**Date:** 2025-04-04  
**Developer:** Dong Ming  
**Branch:** dming/mvp  

## Overview

Implemented a collapsible visualization dashboard for the Folio application, focusing on providing users with a comprehensive view of their portfolio through various charts and metrics. This implementation addresses the P0 priority for high ROI visualizations in the MVP roadmap.

## Changes Made

### 1. Collapsible Dashboard Structure
- Created a collapsible dashboard section that contains all visualizations
- Positioned it near the top of the app, right after the upload section
- Made each chart component individually collapsible
- Moved the positions table to the end of the app

### 2. Chart Components
- Converted all chart components to use collapsible cards
- Added icons and improved styling for each chart section
- Made the charts responsive for different screen sizes
- Implemented collapsible functionality with toggle buttons

### 3. Key Metrics Dashboard
- Added a summary dashboard with key portfolio metrics:
  - Total Value
  - Portfolio Beta
  - Long Exposure
  - Short Exposure
  - Options Exposure (added as requested)

### 4. Visualization Types Implemented
- Asset Allocation Chart (stocks, options, cash)
- Exposure Breakdown (long, short, options, net)
- Position Size Treemap
- Sector Allocation

### 5. Technical Improvements
- Reorganized the utility functions into a proper package structure
- Fixed circular import issues
- Created dedicated modules for formatting and beta calculation
- Improved CSS styling for the dashboard components

## Challenges and Solutions

### Circular Import Issues
- Encountered circular import issues with the utils package
- Resolved by restructuring the utility functions into dedicated modules:
  - `formatting.py` for currency and percentage formatting
  - `beta.py` for beta calculation utilities
- Updated import statements throughout the codebase

### Options Exposure Display
- Initially missed options exposure in the dashboard metrics
- Added options exposure to both the dashboard metrics and charts
- Ensured options exposure is properly represented in all visualizations

## Testing

Tested the implementation with the sample portfolio data. All visualizations render correctly and provide accurate information about the portfolio. The collapsible sections work as expected, allowing users to focus on the data they care about most.

## Next Steps

1. Implement portfolio simulation feature (showing performance if SPY changes by N%)
2. Add more detailed sector allocation analysis
3. Enhance the treemap visualization with additional metrics
4. Improve the mobile responsiveness of the dashboard
