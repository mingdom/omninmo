# Phase 2A Stability Analysis

## Overview
Conducted a second training run to analyze the stability and reproducibility of our risk-focused model improvements. The analysis compares two consecutive training runs with identical parameters.

## Training Configuration
- Forward prediction window: 90 days
- Training period: 10 years
- Dataset size: 111,191 samples
- Features: 38 total

## Key Insights

1. Perfect Reproducibility
   - All performance metrics are identical between runs
   - Feature importance rankings and weights show no variation
   - Dataset processing and model training demonstrate complete stability

2. Risk-Focused Model Validation
   - Consistent importance of max_drawdown_90d confirms successful pivot to risk-aware prediction
   - Balanced mix of risk metrics and technical indicators remains stable
   - Feature stability score (0.7882) is consistent but still below target threshold (0.8)

3. Training Process Robustness
   - 100% success rate in processing all 50 tickers
   - Consistent dataset size and feature generation
   - Reliable cross-validation performance across folds

## Implications

1. Model Reliability
   - High reproducibility suggests robust feature engineering
   - Stable feature importance indicates reliable decision-making process
   - Consistent performance metrics validate the risk-focused approach

2. Risk Management
   - Consistent ranking of risk metrics confirms effective integration
   - Stable importance of max_drawdown_90d validates risk-aware prediction strategy
   - Balanced feature importance distribution suggests well-rounded analysis

## Next Steps
1. Proceed with Phase 2B implementation (trend strength indicators)
2. Consider increasing feature stability target threshold above 0.8
3. Implement backtesting to validate drawdown reduction
4. Monitor predictions on high-volatility vs stable stocks
5. Evaluate prediction quality across different market regimes
