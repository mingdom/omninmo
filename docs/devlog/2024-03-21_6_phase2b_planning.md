# Phase 2B Feature Planning (March 21, 2024)

## Overview
Analyzed the planned features from the feature engineering roadmap and created detailed implementation plans for Phase 2B and 2C features. Determined the optimal implementation sequence and recommended ADX as the first feature to implement.

## Work Completed

### Implementation Plans
Created detailed implementation plans for all Phase 2B and 2C features:

1. **Average Directional Index (ADX)**
   - Measures trend strength regardless of direction
   - Distinguishes between strong trends and sideways markets
   - Implementation complexity: Medium

2. **Linear Regression Slope**
   - Quantifies trend strength and quality using statistical methods
   - Identifies steady trends vs. erratic price movements
   - Implementation complexity: Medium-high

3. **MA Acceleration**
   - Detects early signs of trend acceleration/deceleration
   - Provides leading indicators for trend changes
   - Implementation complexity: Medium

4. **Trend Consistency Score**
   - Measures how consistently price moves in trend direction
   - Identifies stocks with steady, reliable trends
   - Implementation complexity: Medium-high

5. **MA Compression/Expansion**
   - Identifies potential breakout opportunities and regime changes
   - Provides early signals for volatility expansion
   - Implementation complexity: Low-medium

### Analysis and Recommendations
Evaluated each feature based on:
- Value-to-effort ratio
- Dependencies on other features
- Alignment with system goals
- Implementation complexity

Recommended implementing **ADX** first due to:
- Highest value-to-effort ratio
- Minimal dependencies
- Strong alignment with feature stability goals
- Moderate complexity with well-defined implementation

### Implementation Sequence
Established a logical implementation sequence:
1. ADX (Phase 2B)
2. Linear Regression Slope (Phase 2B)
3. MA Acceleration (Phase 2B)
4. Trend Consistency Score (Phase 2C)
5. MA Compression/Expansion (Phase 2C)

## Next Steps
1. Implement ADX feature according to the implementation plan
2. Train and evaluate model with the new feature
3. Document results in a devlog entry
4. Based on results, proceed with Linear Regression Slope implementation

## Technical Details
- Created implementation plans in `docs/devplan/` directory:
  - `adx_implementation_plan.md`
  - `linear_regression_implementation_plan.md`
  - `ma_acceleration_implementation_plan.md`
  - `trend_consistency_implementation_plan.md`
  - `ma_compression_implementation_plan.md`
- Created summary document: `docs/devplan/phase2b_implementation_summary.md`
- Estimated timeline: 3-4 weeks for complete Phase 2B and 2C implementation
