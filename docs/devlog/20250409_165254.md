# Price Update Functionality Improvements

## Overview

This devlog documents significant improvements to the price update functionality in the Folio application. These changes address issues with option exposure recalculation and portfolio estimate value calculation, making the price update feature more accurate and reliable.

This work is part of the [Price Data Model Refactoring](../devplan/2025-04-06-price-data-model-refactoring.md) plan.

## Issues Addressed

Through integration testing, we identified two major issues with the price update functionality:

1. **Option Exposures Not Recalculated**: When prices were updated, option exposures (delta, notional value, delta exposure) were not recalculated based on the new prices.

2. **Portfolio Estimate Value Calculation Error**: There was a significant error in how the portfolio estimate value was calculated after a price update, leading to inconsistent values.

## Changes Made

### 1. Option Exposure Recalculation

- Added a new `parse_option_symbol` function to handle option symbols in the format '-AMAT250516P130'
- Updated the `is_option_desc` function to detect options based on both description and symbol
- Added a `recalculate_option_metrics` function to update option delta, notional value, and delta exposure
- Added a `recalculate_group_metrics` function to update group-level metrics

### 2. Portfolio Estimate Value Calculation

- Updated the `update_portfolio_summary_with_prices` function to include cash-like positions in the recalculation
- Ensured that the portfolio estimate value is calculated consistently as net market exposure + cash-like value

### 3. Integration Testing

- Created a new integration test directory and test file
- Added tests to verify that prices and exposures are updated correctly
- Added a mock test to verify specific calculations
- Added a new make command to run integration tests

### 4. Code Modularity and Performance

- Extracted option recalculation logic into a separate function
- Extracted group metrics recalculation into a separate function
- Improved error handling and logging

## Implementation Details

### Option Symbol Parsing

Added a new function to parse option symbols in the format '-AMAT250516P130':

```python
def parse_option_symbol(symbol: str, quantity: int, current_price: float, description: str | None = None) -> OptionPosition:
    """Parses an option symbol in the format '-AMAT250516P130' into an OptionPosition object."""
    # Extract underlying ticker, expiry date, option type, and strike price
    # Return an OptionPosition object
```

### Option Exposure Recalculation

Added a function to recalculate option metrics when prices are updated:

```python
def recalculate_option_metrics(option, group, latest_prices):
    """Recalculate option metrics based on updated prices."""
    # Get the underlying price
    # Create a parsed option object
    # Recalculate delta using Black-Scholes model
    # Update notional value, delta exposure, and beta-adjusted exposure
```

### Group Metrics Recalculation

Added a function to recalculate group-level metrics:

```python
def recalculate_group_metrics(group):
    """Recalculate group-level metrics based on updated position metrics."""
    # Calculate total delta exposure from options
    # Update group metrics (net exposure, beta-adjusted exposure)
```

### Portfolio Summary Update

Updated the portfolio summary calculation to include cash-like positions:

```python
def update_portfolio_summary_with_prices(portfolio_groups, summary, data_fetcher=None):
    """Update the portfolio summary with the latest prices."""
    # Update prices for all positions
    # Extract cash-like positions from the current summary
    # Recalculate the portfolio summary with updated prices and cash-like positions
    # Update the portfolio_estimate_value to include both net market exposure and cash-like value
```

## Testing

We created comprehensive integration tests to verify the price update functionality:

1. **Real Portfolio Test**: Tests price updates with a real portfolio, verifying that option exposures and portfolio values are updated correctly.

2. **Mock Data Test**: Tests price updates with mock data, verifying specific calculations and ensuring that all metrics are recalculated correctly.

## Results

The integration tests confirmed that our changes fixed the issues:

1. **Option Exposures Now Updated**: Option exposures are now recalculated correctly when prices are updated, with a significant change in the options exposure total.

2. **Portfolio Estimate Value Calculation Fixed**: The portfolio estimate value is now calculated consistently, with changes that match the net market exposure changes.

## Conclusion

These improvements have significantly enhanced the price update functionality in the Folio application, making it more accurate and reliable. Users can now update prices with confidence, knowing that all portfolio metrics will be recalculated correctly.
