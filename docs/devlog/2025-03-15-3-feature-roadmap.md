# Feature Engineering Roadmap (March 21, 2024)

## Overview
Created a comprehensive feature engineering roadmap document that expands on future plans, feature optimization, and extensibility considerations.

## Changes Implemented

### Documentation
1. Created `docs/devplan/feature-engineering-roadmap.md` with:
   - Detailed implementation plans for new features
   - Analysis of optimal feature count
   - Extensibility strategies for incorporating non-price data

2. Removed future plans section from `docs/features.md` and added a reference to the new roadmap

### Key Components

1. **Feature Additions**
   - Detailed implementation code for Phase 2B trend strength indicators (ADX, linear regression, MA acceleration)
   - Expanded implementation for Phase 2C quality metrics (trend consistency, MA compression)
   - Additional feature concepts beyond the current roadmap

2. **Feature Optimization**
   - Research-based analysis of optimal feature count (30-35 recommended)
   - Advanced feature selection methodologies (permutation importance, RFECV, SHAP)
   - Specific recommendations for feature consolidation and removal

3. **Extensibility Research**
   - Comprehensive analysis of single model vs. ensemble approaches
   - Academic research findings on multi-modal financial prediction
   - Recommended hybrid approach with implementation considerations
   - Integration strategy for fundamental, sentiment, and macroeconomic data

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementation of Phase 2B features
2. Conduct feature optimization analysis
3. Explore prototype for alternative data integration
4. Develop evaluation framework for cross-domain feature performance

## Technical Details
- Created: docs/devplan/feature-engineering-roadmap.md
- Modified: docs/features.md
- Recommended feature count: 30-35 (current: 38)
- Target feature stability score: >0.8 (current: 0.7882)
