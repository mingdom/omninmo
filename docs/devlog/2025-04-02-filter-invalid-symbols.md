# Filter Invalid Symbols in Portfolio Data

**Date**: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This development log documents the implementation of explicit filtering for invalid symbols like "Pending Activity" and "021ESC017" in the portfolio data processing pipeline. These symbols were causing errors during processing, particularly the `'float' object has no attribute 'rstrip'` error when trying to process the "Pending Activity" row.

## Issue Analysis

The portfolio CSV file contains a row with "Pending Activity" as the symbol, which has a significant value ($810,188.97) but no other data. When processing this row, the code was trying to call `symbol_raw.rstrip("*")` but `symbol_raw` was sometimes a float (NaN) instead of a string, causing the error.

While we had previously implemented type checking to handle NaN values, we were still attempting to process these invalid symbols. The `is_valid_ticker` function in `src/lab/portfolio.py` already identified these as invalid symbols, but this validation wasn't being used in the main `process_portfolio_data` function.

## Implementation

We added explicit filtering for invalid symbols at the beginning of the data processing pipeline:

```python
# Filter out invalid entries like "Pending Activity" which aren't actual positions
invalid_symbols = ["Pending Activity", "021ESC017"]
valid_rows = ~df["Symbol"].isin(invalid_symbols)
if (~valid_rows).any():
    filtered_count = (~valid_rows).sum()
    filtered_symbols = df.loc[~valid_rows, "Symbol"].tolist()
    logger.info(f"Filtered out {filtered_count} invalid entries: {filtered_symbols}")
    df = df[valid_rows].reset_index(drop=True)
    logger.info(f"Continuing with {len(df)} remaining rows")
```

This change ensures that invalid symbols are filtered out before any processing is attempted, preventing errors later in the pipeline.

## Documentation Updates

We also updated the `BEST_PRACTICES.md` file to include a note about the test portfolio location:

```markdown
- **Test Portfolio**: Use `src/lab/portfolio.csv` for testing with real portfolio data (note: this file is gitignored for privacy reasons but available locally)
```

This ensures that developers are aware of the test portfolio file and its location, which is important for testing the application with real data.

## Testing

The changes were tested by running the application with the sample portfolio data and verifying that:

1. The "Pending Activity" row is filtered out before processing
2. No `'float' object has no attribute 'rstrip'` errors occur
3. The application processes the portfolio data correctly

## Conclusion

By explicitly filtering out invalid symbols at the beginning of the data processing pipeline, we've made the application more robust and prevented errors that were occurring during processing. This approach is more maintainable than adding special case handling throughout the code, as it addresses the issue at its source.
