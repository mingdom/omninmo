# Documentation Update (2023-04-18)

## Summary

Updated and created documentation to better reflect the current state of the system and provide guidance for future development.

## Changes Made

1. **Updated Architecture Document**
   - Enhanced component descriptions to accurately reflect current implementation
   - Updated configuration system details to include multi-file support
   - Added details about MLflow integration and enhanced features
   - Expanded performance optimization and future enhancement sections

2. **Created Developer Guide**
   - Comprehensive onboarding document for new developers
   - Detailed project structure explanation
   - Setup instructions and environment configuration
   - Core component usage examples with code snippets
   - Development workflow guidelines and best practices
   - Debugging and deployment instructions

3. **Created Future Experiments Document**
   - Outlined potential model enhancements (ensemble methods, deep learning, Bayesian approaches)
   - Suggested feature engineering improvements (alternative data, advanced indicators, selection techniques)
   - Proposed system performance optimizations (distributed computing, GPU acceleration)
   - Described market-specific enhancements (regime detection, sector dynamics)
   - Provided implementation roadmap with short, medium, and long-term goals
   - Established evaluation framework for future experiments

## Motivation

The documentation update was necessary to:
1. Ensure new team members can quickly understand the system architecture
2. Provide clear guidance on development practices and conventions
3. Document the current state of the system accurately
4. Outline future directions and experiments to guide ongoing development

## Next Steps

1. Keep documentation updated as system evolves
2. Consider implementing some of the future experiments based on priority
3. Create additional documentation on model evaluation and performance metrics
4. Add tutorials for common development tasks
