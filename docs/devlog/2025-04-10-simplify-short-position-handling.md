# Simplify Short Position Handling

Date: 2025-04-10

## Summary

This update simplifies the handling of short positions in the codebase by removing redundant properties and using the sign of the quantity directly to determine if a position is short.

## Changes

### 1. Removed Redundant `is_short` Property

- Removed the `is_short` property from the `OptionPosition` class
- Updated all code that used `option.is_short` to use `option.quantity < 0` directly
- Updated the documentation to clarify that a position is considered short if quantity < 0

### 2. Updated the Plan for Short Position Representation

- Modified the plan in `docs/devplan/calculation-issues.md` to reflect the simpler approach
- Removed the recommendation to add an `is_short` property to the `StockPosition` class
- Updated the progress document to reflect the changes

## Technical Details

The key insight is that we don't need a separate property to determine if a position is short when the quantity already indicates that with its sign. This simplifies the code and reduces redundancy.

The changes ensure that:
- Short positions are consistently represented with negative quantities
- Code directly checks `quantity < 0` to determine if a position is short
- Documentation clearly states that negative quantities represent short positions

## Related Issues

This change addresses part of the "Fix Short Position Representation" item in the calculation issues plan.

## Testing

All tests are now passing, confirming that the changes work correctly.
