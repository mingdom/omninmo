# Roadmap Update with Progress Tracking (March 21, 2024)

## Overview
Updated the feature engineering roadmap to include a comprehensive progress tracking checklist and reflect the current status of implementation. This update provides better visibility into completed work and upcoming tasks.

## Changes Implemented

### Progress Tracking Checklist
Added a high-level progress tracking checklist at the top of the roadmap document with:
- Checkboxes for completed and pending tasks
- Hierarchical organization by implementation phase
- Detailed sub-tasks for each feature
- Current status indicators

### Status Updates
1. **Feature Optimization**
   - Marked as completed with checkmarks
   - Updated feature count from 38 to 31
   - Updated feature stability score to 0.7840
   - Documented specific removals (return metrics, Bollinger Bands, MA features)

2. **Phase 2B: Trend Strength Indicators**
   - Marked ADX as the next implementation
   - Added implementation, testing, and evaluation sub-tasks
   - Updated timeline to April 2024

3. **Phase 2C and Extensibility**
   - Added detailed sub-tasks
   - Updated timeline estimates

### Content Updates
1. **Updated metrics**
   - Current feature count: 31 (target: 30-35)
   - Current feature stability: 0.7840 (target: >0.8)
   - Current cross-validation R²: 0.6503 (target: >0.65)

2. **Updated implementation timeline**
   - Feature Optimization: ✓ Completed (March 2024)
   - Phase 2B: In progress (April 2024)
   - Phase 2C: Planned (May 2024)
   - Extensibility: Planned (June-August 2024)

3. **Updated conclusion**
   - Added summary of progress to date
   - Highlighted next steps with ADX implementation

## Benefits
1. **Improved visibility** into project progress
2. **Clear tracking** of completed vs. pending tasks
3. **Up-to-date metrics** reflecting current system state
4. **Realistic timeline** based on implementation progress

## Next Steps
1. Implement ADX feature according to the implementation plan
2. Update the roadmap checklist as features are implemented
3. Track performance metrics against targets

## Technical Details
- Modified: docs/devplan/feature-engineering-roadmap.md
- Added progress tracking for 5 major implementation phases
- Updated metrics to reflect current model performance
