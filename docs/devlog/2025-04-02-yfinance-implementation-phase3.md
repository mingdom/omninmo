# YFinance Implementation - Phase 3 Completion

**Date:** 2025-04-02
**Author:** Auggie
**Status:** Completed

## Overview

This development log documents the successful completion of Phase 3 of the yfinance implementation plan. With this phase, we've fully integrated the YFinanceDataFetcher with the existing codebase and made it the default data source for the application.

## Accomplishments

### 1. Created the DataFetcherInterface

Implemented a common interface for data fetchers in `src/data_fetcher_interface.py`:
- Defined abstract methods for `fetch_data` and `fetch_market_data`
- Set a default 6-month period for beta calculations
- Provided comprehensive documentation for all methods

### 2. Updated Both Data Fetchers to Implement the Interface

- Modified the FMP `DataFetcher` class to implement the interface
- Updated the YFinance `YFinanceDataFetcher` class to implement the interface
- Ensured both implementations use the 6-month period for beta calculations
- Updated default cache directories to use hidden folders (.cache_fmp and .cache_yf)

### 3. Created the Factory Function

Implemented a factory function in `src/data_fetcher_factory.py`:
- Provides runtime selection between FMP and yfinance data sources
- Sets appropriate default cache directories based on the selected data source
- Includes comprehensive error handling and logging

### 4. Updated the Utils Module

Modified `src/folio/utils.py` to use the factory function:
- Added code to load configuration from `folio.yaml`
- Gets the data source from configuration (defaults to "yfinance")
- Creates the data fetcher using the factory function
- Includes robust error handling for configuration loading and data fetcher creation

### 5. Created Configuration File

Created a comprehensive configuration file at `src/folio/folio.yaml`:
- Set yfinance as the default data source
- Included configuration for cache, beta calculation, UI, and logging
- Provided clear documentation for all configuration options

## Testing Results

All tests are now passing, confirming that our implementation is working correctly:
- Updated tests to match the new default cache directories
- Verified that both data fetchers implement the interface correctly
- Confirmed that the factory function creates the appropriate data fetcher
- Tested the application with yfinance as the default data source

## Implementation Details

### DataFetcherInterface

```python
class DataFetcherInterface(ABC):
    """Interface for data fetchers"""

    # Default period for beta calculations
    beta_period = "6m"

    @abstractmethod
    def fetch_data(self, ticker, period="1y", interval="1d"):
        """Fetch stock data for a ticker"""
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def fetch_market_data(self, market_index="SPY", period=None, interval="1d"):
        """Fetch market index data for beta calculations"""
        pass
```

### Factory Function

```python
def create_data_fetcher(source="yfinance", cache_dir=None):
    """Factory function to create the appropriate data fetcher"""
    # Set default cache directories based on data source
    if cache_dir is None:
        cache_dir = ".cache_yf" if source == "yfinance" else ".cache_fmp"

    if source == "yfinance":
        from src.yfinance import YFinanceDataFetcher
        logger.info(f"Creating YFinance data fetcher with cache dir: {cache_dir}")
        return YFinanceDataFetcher(cache_dir=cache_dir)
    elif source == "fmp":
        from src.v2.data_fetcher import DataFetcher
        logger.info(f"Creating FMP data fetcher with cache dir: {cache_dir}")
        return DataFetcher(cache_dir=cache_dir)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unknown data source: {source}")
```

### Configuration Loading

```python
# Load configuration from folio.yaml
def load_config():
    config_path = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'folio.yaml')
    if os.path.exists(config_path):
        try:
            with open(config_path, 'r') as f:
                return yaml.safe_load(f)
        except Exception as e:
            logger.warning(f"Failed to load folio.yaml: {e}. Using default configuration.")
    return {}

# Get configuration
config = load_config()

# Initialize data fetcher
try:
    # Get data source from config (default to "yfinance" if not specified)
    data_source = config.get("app", {}).get("data_source", "yfinance")
    logger.info(f"Using data source: {data_source}")

    # Create data fetcher using factory
    data_fetcher = create_data_fetcher(source=data_source)

    if data_fetcher is None:
        raise RuntimeError(
            "Data fetcher initialization failed but didn't raise an exception"
        )
except ValueError as e:
    logger.error(f"Failed to initialize data fetcher: {e}")
    # Re-raise to fail fast rather than continuing with a null reference
    raise RuntimeError(
        f"Critical component data fetcher could not be initialized: {e}"
    ) from e
```

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Flexibility**: Users can now choose between FMP and yfinance data sources through configuration
2. **No API Key Required**: With yfinance as the default, new users don't need to obtain an API key
3. **More Accurate Beta Values**: Using a 6-month period for beta calculations provides more current market relationships
4. **Improved Code Structure**: The interface and factory pattern make the code more maintainable and extensible
5. **Better Configuration**: The new config.yaml file provides a central location for all configuration options

## Conclusion

With the completion of Phase 3, we've successfully integrated the YFinanceDataFetcher with the existing codebase and made it the default data source for the application. This implementation provides several benefits, including eliminating the need for an API key, providing more accurate beta values, and improving the overall code structure.

The application now uses yfinance by default, but users can still switch to the FMP API if needed by changing the configuration. All tests are passing, and the application is running successfully with the new data source.

This completes the yfinance implementation project, providing a more accessible and maintainable solution for fetching financial data.
