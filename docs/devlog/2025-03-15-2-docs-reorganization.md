# Documentation Reorganization (March 21, 2024)

## Overview
Reorganized the documentation structure to better separate current implementation details from development plans and progress tracking.

## Changes Implemented

### Directory Structure
1. Created `docs/devplan/` directory for future plans and proposals
2. Moved planning documents to `devplan/`:
   - model-phase2-proposal.md
   - model-phase1-improvements.md
   - model-midterm.md
   - model-analysis-howto.md
   - remove-v1.md

### Documentation
1. Created `docs/README.md` as master index with:
   - Documentation philosophy
   - File organization explanation
   - Guidelines for updates
   - Contributing instructions

2. Organized documentation into three categories:
   - Top-level docs: Current implementation
   - devplan/: Future improvements
   - devlog/: Implementation progress

### Documentation Philosophy
1. **Current Implementation** (top-level)
   - Single source of truth
   - Always up-to-date
   - Implementation details

2. **Development Plans** (devplan/)
   - Future proposals
   - Design documents
   - May not reflect current state

3. **Implementation Progress** (devlog/)
   - Daily progress
   - Decision tracking
   - Historical context

## Next Steps
1. Review and update top-level docs for accuracy
2. Add cross-references between related documents
3. Consider adding diagrams to architecture.md
4. Create templates for devlog and devplan entries

## Technical Details
- Created: docs/README.md
- Created: docs/devplan/
- Moved: 5 planning documents to devplan/
