# Updated Linting Rules for Magic Numbers

## Changes Made
1. Modified the linting configuration in `pyproject.toml`:
   - Added `PLR2004` (magic value used in comparison) to the list of ignored rules
   - This prevents warnings about literal numeric constants in conditionals
   
2. Reverted the constant definition approach in `src/folio/utils.py`:
   - Went back to using the literal value `6` directly in the code
   - Preferred solution is to ignore the rule rather than add unnecessary constants

## Testing
- Verified that `make lint` now passes with no warnings about magic numbers
- Confirmed that `make test` continues to work correctly

## Rationale
For data science and financial applications, many numeric values have specific domain meaning and don't need to be extracted as constants. Ignoring this rule reduces code noise and maintains simplicity while preserving functionality.
