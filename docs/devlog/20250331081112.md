# Fixed Position Details Modal Rendering

## Issue
When clicking the "Details" button for a position, the modal would initially appear to be triggered but would not actually show, or would show with errors. Investigation revealed that the `create_position_details` function was trying to access a non-existent `ticker` attribute directly on the `PortfolioGroup` object.

## Root Cause
In `position_details.py`, the `create_position_details` function contained:
```python
html.H3(f"{group.ticker} Position Details", className="mb-4")
```

Just like the previous issue with the portfolio table, this code was trying to access `group.ticker` directly, but the `PortfolioGroup` class doesn't have a `ticker` attribute. This was causing an error when attempting to render the modal content.

## Solution
1. Imported the `get_group_ticker` helper function that we previously created:
   ```python
   from .portfolio_table import get_group_ticker
   ```

2. Used this helper function to correctly get the ticker for the position:
   ```python
   # Get the ticker for this group
   ticker = get_group_ticker(group)
   ```

3. Updated the heading to use this extracted ticker:
   ```python
   html.H3(f"{ticker} Position Details", className="mb-4")
   ```

4. Added enhanced error logging throughout the application to help diagnose any further issues

## Result
The position details modal now properly appears when clicking either the table row or the Details button. The modal correctly displays all the position information including stock details, option details (if any), and the combined metrics.

This fix ensures a consistent approach to accessing ticker information throughout the application using the `get_group_ticker` helper function.
