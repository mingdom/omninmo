# Portfolio Table Sorting Implementation

## Changes Made

1. Added sortable headers to the portfolio table with appropriate visual indicators:
   - Added sort icons (up/down/neutral) to indicate sort direction
   - Made headers clickable with cursor feedback
   - Added hover state styling for better UX

2. Implemented sort state management:
   - Added a dcc.Store component to maintain sort state
   - Created callback to update sort state when headers are clicked
   - Default sorting by value (descending)

3. Fixed sort logic implementation:
   - Updated sort functions to match actual displayed values:
     - "value" column: sorts by net_exposure (correct)
     - "beta" column: now sorts by beta_adjusted_exposure / net_exposure (the actual displayed beta)
     - "exposure" column: now sorts by beta_adjusted_exposure (the main number shown)
     - "ticker" column: sorts alphabetically
     - "type" column: sorts by position type (stocks first, then options)

## Issues Fixed

Fixed incorrect sorting behavior where columns were being sorted by values that didn't match what was being displayed:
- Beta column now sorts by the exact beta value shown (beta_adjusted_exposure / net_exposure)
- Exposure column now sorts by beta_adjusted_exposure instead of total_delta_exposure

Fixed handling of negative values in sorting by removing absolute value calculations:
- Previously, values like -100 and +100 would be treated as equal in sorting (using abs())
- Now, negative numbers sort correctly relative to positive numbers

This ensures the sorting works intuitively for users and matches expectations when viewing the portfolio table.
