# Phase 2A Implementation: Risk-Focused Features

## Overview
Implementation of Phase 2A changes focusing on risk management features and removal of volatility bias. This phase aims to improve the model's ability to identify steady growth trends while reducing sensitivity to high-volatility stocks.

## Changes Implemented

### Feature Engineering Updates
1. Removed volatility-based features
2. Added new risk management features:
   - Rolling maximum drawdown (90d, 180d)
   - Rolling Sharpe ratio (90d window)
   - Risk-adjusted momentum
   - Price stability score

### Training Configuration
- Forward prediction window: 90 days
- Training period: 10 years
- Dataset size: 111,191 samples
- Features: 38 total

## Results

### Model Performance
- Cross-validation R²: 0.6809 ± 0.0131 (decreased from 0.7733)
- Final model R²: 0.7610
- Cross-validation RMSE: 0.2586 ± 0.0083
- Feature stability score: 0.7882 (improved from 0.7816)

### Top Feature Importance
1. max_drawdown_90d: 0.1028
2. ema_21: 0.0751
3. sma_50: 0.0734
4. bb_std: 0.0689
5. sma_200: 0.0538

### Key Insights
1. Successful shift from volatility-based to risk-aware prediction
   - max_drawdown_90d is now the top feature
   - Traditional technical indicators remain important but balanced with risk metrics
   - Volatility features no longer dominate predictions

2. Model Behavior Changes
   - Lower R² suggests more conservative predictions
   - Improved feature stability indicates more consistent decision making
   - Risk features effectively counterbalance pure momentum signals

3. Risk Management Impact
   - Model now incorporates drawdown considerations in predictions
   - Price stability score helps identify steady trends
   - Risk-adjusted momentum provides better quality signals

## Next Steps
1. Monitor predictions on high-volatility vs stable stocks
2. Consider implementing Phase 2B with trend strength indicators (ADX)
3. Fine-tune risk feature weights if needed
4. Add backtesting to validate drawdown reduction
5. Evaluate prediction quality on different market regimes
