# Added Stop-Folio Target to Makefile

## Issue
The portfolio dashboard server sometimes gets orphaned when the application is interrupted or not properly terminated. This leads to port conflicts when trying to start a new server instance, as the old process is still running and occupying the port.

## Solution
Added a new `stop-folio` target to the Makefile that:

1. Finds all running Python processes that contain "folio" in their command line
2. Extracts the process IDs (PIDs) of these processes
3. Gracefully terminates each process with `kill -9`
4. Provides appropriate feedback to the user about which processes were found and terminated

## Usage
To stop all running folio dashboard instances:
```
make stop-folio
```

This ensures a clean environment before starting a new dashboard instance and prevents port conflicts from orphaned processes.
