# 2024-03-14: Added Training Executive Summary

## Changes Made

1. Created new module `src/v2/training_summary.py` to handle training summaries
2. Added functions:
   - `generate_training_summary()`: Creates structured summary of training results
   - `save_training_summary()`: Saves summary to JSON and prints executive summary
3. Modified `train.py` to use the new summary functionality
4. Created `logs/training/` directory to store historical training results

## Technical Details

### Summary Structure
- Timestamp and model configuration
- Data coverage statistics
- Cross-validation metrics with standard deviations
- Final model performance
- Feature importance analysis
  - Top 10 most important features
  - Feature stability score
  - Cumulative importance of top features

### Storage Format
- JSON files with timestamp-based naming
- Human-readable console output
- Structured for easy comparison between training runs

## Benefits

1. **Tracking Progress**
   - Easy comparison between training runs
   - Clear visibility of model improvements
   - Historical record of feature importance

2. **Model Quality**
   - Immediate feedback on model stability
   - Clear success metrics
   - Feature importance trends

3. **Data Quality**
   - Tracking of processed vs skipped tickers
   - Success rate monitoring
   - Error tracking

## Next Steps

1. Consider adding:
   - Comparison tool for multiple training runs
   - Visualization of training history
   - Automated alerts for significant changes

2. Monitor:
   - Storage usage of summary files
   - Most commonly skipped tickers
   - Feature stability trends
