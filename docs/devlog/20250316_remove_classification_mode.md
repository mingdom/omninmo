# Remove Classification Mode

## Goal
The goal was to simplify the codebase by removing the classification mode option, focusing solely on regression functionality. This makes the code easier to maintain by removing unused code paths.

## Changes Made

### Modified Files
- `src/v2/training_summary.py`: Removed classification-specific code branches
- `scripts/v2_train.py`: Updated to remove mode parameter

### Key Changes
1. Hardcoded "regression" mode instead of using `predictor.mode`
2. Removed conditional branches that checked for classification mode
3. Removed classification-specific metrics logging
4. Kept all regression functionality intact

## Approach
Used a surgical approach to only remove the specific classification code while preserving all regression functionality:

1. In `generate_training_summary()`: Removed the mode-checking conditionals, keeping only the regression metrics
2. In `save_training_summary()`: Removed classification output branch in console logs
3. In `log_mlflow_metrics()`: Updated to only log regression metrics

## Testing
Verified changes by running `make train` successfully. The command now completes without errors, and the model is trained with the same regression functionality as before.

## Lessons Learned
1. Making targeted, minimal changes is safer than rewriting entire functions
2. Understanding all dependencies before removing code is crucial to avoid breaking existing functionality
3. Following the KISS principle (Keep It Simple Stupid) helps prevent introducing new bugs
