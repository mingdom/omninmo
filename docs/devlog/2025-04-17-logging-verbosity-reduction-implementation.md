## Overview

This development log documents the implementation of the logging verbosity reduction plan outlined in `docs/devplan/2025-04-17-logging-verbosity-reduction.md`. The goal was to make the INFO and higher log levels less spammy by changing appropriate INFO logs to DEBUG level, while preserving important information for troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Configuration Integration

Enhanced the logger configuration to use settings from `folio.yaml`:

- Modified `src/folio/logger.py` to read log level and log file name from the configuration file
- Added a fallback mechanism to use environment variables if configuration is not available
- Improved documentation to reflect the new configuration options
- Added logging of the configured log level at initialization

### 2. Log Level Adjustments

Changed many INFO level logs to DEBUG level across multiple files:

#### src/folio/app.py
- Changed initialization and configuration logs to DEBUG
- Changed routine callback execution logs to DEBUG
- Changed detailed data processing logs to DEBUG
- Preserved INFO logs for important events like file uploads and successful portfolio processing

#### src/folio/portfolio.py
- Changed detailed portfolio processing logs to DEBUG
- Changed position grouping and analysis logs to DEBUG
- Changed option processing logs to DEBUG
- Changed portfolio summary calculation logs to DEBUG
- Changed detailed summary metrics logs to DEBUG
- Preserved INFO logs for critical events like portfolio loading completion

#### src/folio/components/charts.py
- Changed chart creation and registration logs to DEBUG
- Changed data transformation logs to DEBUG

#### src/folio/components/summary_cards.py
- Changed card creation and registration logs to DEBUG
- Changed routine update logs to DEBUG

### 3. Preserved INFO Logs

Maintained INFO level for important events:

- Application startup and access information
- Data source configuration
- File uploads and processing results
- Critical portfolio processing results
- Pending activity value inclusion
- Portfolio loading completion

## Benefits

1. **Cleaner Logs**: INFO and higher logs are now less cluttered, making it easier to identify important events
2. **Better Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Important events stand out more clearly in the logs
3. **Smaller Log Files**: Log files will be smaller when running at INFO level
4. **Preserved Debugging Capability**: All detailed information is still available at DEBUG level

## Configuration Options

The logging level can now be configured in multiple ways (in order of precedence):

1. **Environment Variable**: `LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG|INFO|WARNING|ERROR|CRITICAL`
2. **Configuration File**: In `src/folio/folio.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   app:
     logging:
       level: "DEBUG"  # or "INFO", "WARNING", "ERROR", "CRITICAL"
       file: "folio_latest.log"  # Custom log file name
   ```
3. **Default Values**: INFO for normal environments, WARNING for Hugging Face

## Future Improvements

1. **Component-Level Log Control**: Consider allowing different log levels for different components
2. **Log Rotation**: Implement log rotation for log files to manage disk space better
3. **Structured Logging**: Consider implementing structured logging for better log analysis
