# Fixed Position Details Button in Portfolio Dashboard

## Issue
When clicking the "Details" button for a position in the portfolio table, the modal wasn't opening and no details were displayed. The application was using the table's `active_cell` property to identify which row was clicked, but this doesn't work properly with button clicks inside the table.

## Analysis
The "Details" button in each row was correctly configured with a pattern-matching ID:
```python
id={"type": "position-details", "index": ticker}
```

However, there was no callback in app.py that was listening for clicks on this button with a pattern-matching ID. The application was only listening for the table's `active_cell` property to change.

## Solution
1. Added proper imports for pattern-matching callback IDs:
   ```python
   from dash import Input, Output, State, ALL, MATCH, dcc, html
   ```

2. Updated the `store_selected_position` callback to listen for both table cell clicks and Details button clicks:
   ```python
   @app.callback(
       Output("selected-position", "data"),
       [
           Input("portfolio-table", "active_cell"),
           Input({"type": "position-details", "index": ALL}, "n_clicks"),
       ],
       [
           State("portfolio-data", "data"),
           State("portfolio-table", "active_cell"),
       ],
   )
   ```

3. Modified the callback to determine which trigger caused it:
   - For button clicks, extract the ticker from the button ID and find the matching position
   - For table cell clicks, use the active_cell row as before

4. Enhanced the `toggle_position_modal` callback to properly determine when to open or close the modal by checking which trigger fired the callback

These changes ensure that clicking either the table row or the Details button will correctly open the modal and display the position details.
