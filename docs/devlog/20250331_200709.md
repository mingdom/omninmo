# Implied Volatility Estimation Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a non-API approach to estimate implied volatility for options, enhancing the accuracy of Black-Scholes delta calculations.

## Implementation Details

1. **Black-Scholes Pricing Function**:
   - Added `calculate_bs_price` to compute theoretical option prices
   - Properly handles calls and puts with appropriate math for intrinsic value

2. **Implied Volatility Solver**:
   - Created `calculate_implied_volatility` using bisection method
   - Iteratively converges on the volatility that produces the observed market price
   - Handles edge cases (intrinsic value, expired options)

3. **Volatility Skew Model**:
   - Implemented `estimate_volatility_with_skew` for options without market data
   - Models volatility smile (higher IV for OTM options)
   - Accounts for term structure (higher IV for shorter-term options)
   - Provides reasonable defaults based on moneyness and time to expiration

4. **Unified Interface**:
   - Modified `calculate_option_delta` to automatically estimate IV when not provided
   - Falls back gracefully through various estimation methods

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests that verify:
- Core Black-Scholes pricing is accurate
- IV solver can back-calculate known volatilities
- Volatility remains within reasonable bounds
- Skew model produces expected patterns
- Integration works end-to-end

## Benefits

1. **Accuracy**: More precise delta calculations leading to better risk assessment
2. **Realism**: Volatility skew reflects actual market behavior
3. **Robustness**: Fallback mechanisms ensure we always have a reasonable value
4. **Flexibility**: Allows both market-derived and estimated IVs

## Example Usage

The implementation provides flexible handling of implied volatility:

```python
# With market price - calculates IV
delta = calculate_option_delta(option, underlying_price)

# With explicit IV
delta = calculate_option_delta(option, underlying_price, implied_volatility=0.40)

# Using simple model instead
delta = calculate_option_delta(option, underlying_price, use_black_scholes=False)
```

This approach significantly improves our portfolio risk metrics by providing more accurate deltas and better capturing the nuances of options pricing.
