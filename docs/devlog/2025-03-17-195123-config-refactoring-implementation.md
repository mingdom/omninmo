# Config Refactoring Implementation - 2025-03-17

## Summary
Implemented the configuration refactoring plan by splitting the monolithic `config.yaml` file into multiple smaller, focused YAML files in a `config` directory. Following the principle of keeping things simple, all unused configuration values were removed rather than preserved as deprecated.

## Changes Made
1. Created a new `config` directory with 5 clean configuration files:
   - `model.yaml` - ML model parameters
   - `features.yaml` - Feature engineering parameters
   - `app.yaml` - App settings (only watchlist and cache settings)
   - `data.yaml` - API access and max age settings (removed unused sample data)
   - `config.yaml` - Main file importing the above files

2. Enhanced the `src/v2/config.py` module to:
   - Support both the new multi-file structure and legacy single-file approach
   - Automatically detect and use the new structure if available
   - Fall back to the legacy file if needed

3. Cleaned up configuration by removing ALL unused settings:
   - Completely removed files for unused configurations (rating, logging, charts)
   - Removed unused sections from partially used files
   - Simplified the main `config.yaml` to only import active files

4. Updated the original `config.yaml` file to be a minimal reference to the new structure

## Technical Details
- The enhanced `Config` class now looks for a `config` directory with a `config.yaml` file
- If found, it loads the main file and all imported files
- Each imported file contributes settings to a specific section in the configuration
- The dot-notation access pattern remains unchanged, maintaining backward compatibility
- All existing code should continue to work without modification

## Benefits
- Better organization of related settings
- Easier to locate and modify specific configurations
- Reduced merge conflicts when multiple developers work on different aspects
- Significantly smaller configuration overall with less clutter
- Greater simplicity with only actively used settings retained
- Preserved backward compatibility while improving structure

## Next Steps
- Testing in different environments to ensure the configuration loading works correctly
- Consider adding validation for configuration files
- Consider implementing automated tests for configuration loading
