# Validation Utilities Implementation

Date: 2025-04-11

## Summary

This development log documents the implementation of validation utilities for the Folio application. These utilities provide a more consistent and robust way to validate and clean data throughout the codebase, particularly for option data processing.

## Changes

### 1. Created `src/folio/validation.py` Module

Created a new module with the following validation utilities:

- `validate_option_data`: Validates option data from a DataFrame row and returns cleaned values
- `extract_option_data`: Extracts and validates option data from a DataFrame
- `validate_dataframe`: Validates that a DataFrame exists and has the required columns
- `clean_numeric_value`: Cleans and validates numeric values with support for currency formatting

### 2. Added Comprehensive Tests

Created a new test file `tests/test_validation.py` with comprehensive tests for all validation utilities:

- Tests for valid and invalid option data
- Tests for extracting options with filters
- Tests for DataFrame validation
- Tests for numeric value cleaning with various formats and constraints

## Benefits

1. **Improved Error Handling**: The validation utilities provide more specific error messages and better error handling.

2. **Reduced Code Duplication**: Common validation logic is now centralized in reusable functions.

3. **Consistent Validation**: The same validation logic is used throughout the codebase, ensuring consistent behavior.

4. **Better Type Safety**: The validation utilities include proper type annotations and return cleaned values with the correct types.

## Next Steps

In the next phase, we'll refactor the option processing code in `src/folio/portfolio.py` to use these validation utilities, which will:

1. Reduce code bloat by eliminating duplicate validation logic
2. Improve error handling with more specific error messages
3. Make the code more maintainable and easier to understand
