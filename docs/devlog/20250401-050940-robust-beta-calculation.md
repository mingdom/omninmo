# Robust Beta Calculation and Symbol Validation

## Summary
Implemented pattern-based symbol validation and improved beta calculation to eliminate hardcoded symbol lists and make asset classification more robust.

## Key Changes

### Removed Hardcoded Symbol Lists
- Eliminated hardcoded `KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS` and `TREASURY_ETFS` lists
- Replaced with pattern recognition and beta-based classification
- Added proper regex patterns for symbol validation

### Improved Error Handling in Beta Calculation
- Fixed market variance zero handling - now properly raising an error for this mathematically undefined case
- Added better data validation for stock returns and market data
- Improved error messages with more context
- Fixed edge cases where `get_beta()` would incorrectly return 0 for international ETFs

### Proper Classification of Assets
- Fixed TLT (Treasury ETF) being incorrectly treated as a regular stock when it has very low beta
- Ensured international ETFs like MCHI (China) and IEFA (International) are properly classified with their actual betas (~0.7-0.8)
- Refined threshold for cash-like positions to be more conservative (beta < 0.02)

## Benefits
1. More robust handling of different asset types based on actual market behavior
2. No need to maintain hard-coded lists of symbols that need special handling
3. Proper propagation of mathematical errors (like division by zero in beta calculation)
4. More accurate classification of assets based on their actual market correlation

## Testing
- Updated unit tests to match new behavior
- Added verification script for ETF classification
- All tests are now passing with the improved implementation
