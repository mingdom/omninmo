# Fixed Portfolio Dashboard

The portfolio dashboard application has been successfully fixed and is now working correctly. The following issues have been resolved:

1. Fixed the issue with accessing the ticker attribute in the `PortfolioGroup` class by adding a helper function to extract the ticker from either stock or option positions
2. Implemented proper handling of negative values enclosed in parentheses in the portfolio CSV
3. Added robust error handling for option symbol parsing to handle unexpected formats
4. Added flexibility to run the application on different ports to avoid port conflicts
5. Made the portfolio file optional, allowing users to upload their portfolio through the UI

## Usage Instructions

The dashboard can be run in two ways:

1. Without a portfolio file (default):
   ```
   make folio
   ```
   This will start the application with an upload interface where users can upload their portfolio CSV file.

2. With a specific portfolio file:
   ```
   make folio portfolio=path/to/portfolio.csv
   ```
   This will start the application with the specified portfolio file pre-loaded.

3. To specify a custom port (if the default port 8051 is in use):
   ```
   python -m folio --port 8052
   ```

## Testing Results

The application has been tested and is accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8051/ (or the specified port). The portfolio table now properly loads, and the interface allows for filtering and viewing detailed information about positions.
