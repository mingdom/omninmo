# Fundamental Data Integration - Initial Planning

Date: 2025-03-21

Today I completed the initial draft of our fundamental data integration plan for the stock rating tool. The plan aims to address our current system's bias toward high-momentum stocks with questionable fundamentals (like PLTR with its ~100 P/S ratio).

## Key Decisions Made

1. **Adopted a hybrid approach** rather than replacing the existing technical model:
   - Sector-specific fundamental scoring
   - Technical momentum analysis (existing system with adjustments)
   - Combined scoring with dynamic weighting

2. **Expanded metric categories** to include:
   - Comprehensive valuation metrics with sector context
   - Multi-timeframe growth analysis
   - Profitability and quality metrics
   - Relative (sector) comparisons rather than absolute values

3. **Data sourcing strategy**:
   - Primary & secondary validation sources
   - 5-year minimum historical data
   - Sector-specific imputation for missing data

## Next Steps

1. Research and evaluate potential data providers (Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, Polygon.io)
2. Create proof of concept for sector-relative scoring (using S&P 500 stocks)
3. Develop initial data pipeline architecture

## Questions to Resolve

- Should we implement separate models for different market cap ranges?
- How much weight should fundamentals have in initial implementation?
- Do we need different models for different sectors or can we use a single model with sector-specific feature engineering?
