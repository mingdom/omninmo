# Development Log: Cross-Validation Implementation

**Date**: 2024-03-13
**Author**: AI Assistant
**Feature**: K-fold Cross-Validation

## Changes Made

1. Added cross-validation functionality to `src/v2/predictor.py`:
   - Implemented `cross_validate` method
   - Added support for both regression and classification modes
   - Integrated feature importance tracking across folds
   - Added comprehensive logging

2. Created detailed specification in `docs/cross-validation.md`:
   - Full implementation details
   - Usage examples
   - Return value structures
   - Future enhancements
   - Testing strategy

## Implementation Details

### Core Features
- K-fold cross-validation with configurable number of folds (default: 5)
- Support for both regression and classification modes
- Comprehensive metrics tracking:
  - Regression: RMSE, MAE, RÂ²
  - Classification: Accuracy, detailed classification report
- Feature importance analysis across folds
- Detailed logging and progress tracking

### Technical Decisions

1. **Data Handling**:
   - Using scikit-learn's KFold for splitting
   - Maintaining consistent random seed for reproducibility
   - Efficient memory management by processing one fold at a time

2. **Metrics**:
   - Standard deviation tracking for all metrics
   - Per-fold and aggregated results
   - Feature importance stability tracking

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Graceful degradation on fold failures
   - Clear error messages and logging
   - Data validation checks

## Testing

Initial testing shows the implementation works as expected:
- Successfully handles both regression and classification modes
- Memory usage is within acceptable limits
- Results are reproducible with fixed random seed

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**:
   - Add unit tests
   - Implement time-series aware folding
   - Add feature importance stability metrics

2. **Future Enhancements**:
   - Parallel processing support
   - Cross-validation visualization tools
   - Integration with automated reporting system

## Notes

- The implementation follows the proposal in `models.md`
- Added additional features beyond the initial proposal for better usability
- Focused on maintainability and extensibility
- Documented all major components for future reference
