# Portfolio Dashboard Bug Fixes

## Issue 1: Portfolio Table Ticker Reference
The portfolio table was failing to render with the error: `'PortfolioGroup' object has no attribute 'ticker'`. This occurred because the `portfolio_table.py` component was trying to access a non-existent `ticker` attribute directly on the `PortfolioGroup` object.

The `PortfolioGroup` class doesn't have a `ticker` attribute. Instead, tickers are available through:
- `stock_position.ticker` for stock positions
- `option_positions[i].ticker` for option positions

### Solution
1. Added a helper function `get_group_ticker(group)` to extract the primary ticker for a group:
   - Returns the stock position ticker if available
   - Otherwise returns the first option position ticker
   - Returns "Unknown" as a fallback

2. Updated all references to `group.ticker` in the portfolio table component:
   - In `create_position_row()` to use the helper function
   - In search filtering to properly filter by the extracted ticker
   - In row and button IDs to use the correct ticker

3. Added safer splitting of the sort parameter with a fallback to "desc" sorting

## Issue 2: Parsing Currency Values with Parentheses
Several errors were occurring when trying to parse currency values formatted with parentheses for negative values, e.g., `(123.45)` instead of `-123.45`.

### Solution
1. Added a `clean_currency_value` helper function that:
   - Handles empty or dash values by returning 0.0
   - Removes currency symbols and commas
   - Converts parenthesized values to negative values with a minus sign
   - Properly handles type conversion errors

2. Updated all currency value parsing in `process_portfolio_data` to use this helper function

## Issue 3: Option Symbol Parsing Errors
When parsing option symbols (like `PDD-DD250620P120`), errors were occurring due to unexpected formats.

### Solution
1. Added error handling around option symbol parsing:
   - Try-except blocks to catch errors on individual options without failing the entire group
   - Default values for expiry dates when parsing fails
   - Validation for strike prices with fallback to default values
   - Safe type conversion with str() before string operations

These fixes allow the portfolio table to properly render and display information even with varied or problematic data formats in the input CSV.
