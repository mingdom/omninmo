# Improve Data Fetcher Error Handling

**Date**: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This development log documents improvements to the error handling in the DataFetcher class and related functions. The changes ensure that:

1. "No historical data found" errors are downgraded to warnings
2. Empty DataFrames are returned instead of raising exceptions for missing data
3. Symbols with no historical data are not incorrectly classified as cash-like positions

## Issue Analysis

We identified several issues with the current error handling:

1. The DataFetcher was raising exceptions for "No historical data found" errors, which are not critical errors
2. Tests were expecting specific error messages that no longer matched after our changes
3. Symbols with no historical data were being assigned a beta of 0.0, which was causing them to be incorrectly classified as cash-like positions

## Implementation

### 1. DataFetcher Improvements

Modified the DataFetcher to return empty DataFrames instead of raising exceptions:

```python
if "historical" not in data:
    # This is not a critical error - just log a warning and return empty DataFrame
    logger.warning(f"No historical data found for {ticker}")
    return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume"])
```

Also updated the `fetch_data` method to handle empty data more gracefully:

```python
if df is not None and not df.empty:
    # Save to cache
    df.to_csv(cache_file)
    return df
else:
    # Return empty DataFrame with expected columns instead of raising an error
    logger.warning(f"No data returned from API for {ticker}. Returning empty DataFrame.")
    return pd.DataFrame(columns=["Open", "High", "Low", "Close", "Volume"])
```

### 2. Cash-Like Position Detection Improvements

Modified the `is_cash_or_short_term` function to avoid classifying symbols with no historical data as cash-like:

```python
# If beta is 0.0, check if it's because there's no historical data
# We don't want to classify symbols with no data as cash-like
if calculated_beta == 0.0:
    # Check if this is a known cash-like symbol or has cash-like description
    if not (ticker in ["CASH", "USD"] or 
           is_likely_money_market(ticker, description) or
           ticker.upper().endswith("XX")):
        # If not a known cash-like symbol, assume it's not cash-like
        logger.debug(f"Symbol {ticker} has beta=0.0 but is not a known cash-like symbol. Assuming not cash-like.")
        return False
```

### 3. Test Updates

Updated the `test_empty_data_response` test to expect an empty DataFrame instead of an exception:

```python
# Now we expect an empty DataFrame instead of an exception
result = fetcher.fetch_data("INVALID", period="1y")
assert isinstance(result, pd.DataFrame)
assert result.empty or len(result) == 0
assert "Open" in result.columns
assert "Close" in result.columns
```

## Testing

The changes were tested by:

1. Running the specific test that was failing: `python -m pytest tests/test_cash_detection.py::test_pattern_based_detection -v`
2. Running all tests to ensure no regressions: `make test`

All tests now pass, confirming that our changes have fixed the issues without introducing new problems.

## Conclusion

These improvements make the application more robust by:

1. Properly handling missing data without raising unnecessary exceptions
2. Ensuring that symbols with no historical data are not incorrectly classified as cash-like
3. Maintaining compatibility with existing tests and functionality

The changes align with our best practices of minimal edits, simplicity over complexity, and thorough debugging.
