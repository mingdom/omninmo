# Clean Up Scripts Directory

## Summary
Cleaned up the `scripts` directory by removing unused scripts and updating the Makefile to use the `src/v2` modules directly. This simplifies the codebase by removing redundant code and making the execution paths more direct.

## Changes Made

1. Updated Makefile to use src/v2 modules directly:
   - Changed `$(PYTHON) $(SCRIPTS_DIR)/v2_train.py` to `$(PYTHON) -m $(SRC_DIR).train`
   - Changed `$(PYTHON) $(SCRIPTS_DIR)/v2_predict.py` to `$(PYTHON) -m $(SRC_DIR).console_app`
   - Added `SRC_DIR := src/v2` variable for better maintainability

2. Removed unused scripts:
   - `v2_predict.py` - functionality moved to `src/v2/console_app.py`
   - `v2_train.py` - functionality moved to `src/v2/train.py`
   - `make_executable.sh` - one-time setup script, no longer needed
   - `rename_devlogs.sh` - one-time maintenance script
   - `standardize_docs.sh` - one-time maintenance script

3. Kept essential scripts:
   - `setup-venv.sh` - used by `make env`
   - `install-reqs.sh` - used by `make install`
   - `clean.sh` - used by `make clean`
   - `run_mlflow.py` - used by `make mlflow`

## Impact
- Simplified codebase by removing redundant scripts
- More direct execution paths using Python modules
- Clearer separation between core functionality and utility scripts
- Reduced maintenance overhead

## Testing
1. Verify that all make commands still work:
   ```bash
   make train
   make predict
   make mlflow
   make clean
   ```
2. Ensure no functionality is lost after script removal
