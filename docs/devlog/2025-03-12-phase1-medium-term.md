# Phase 1: Medium-Term Model Improvements (March 12, 2024)

## Overview
Implemented Phase 1 improvements to enhance medium-term (90-180 day) prediction capabilities. Focus was on adapting technical indicators and feature engineering for longer time horizons.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Feature Engineering Updates
- **Moving Averages**: Optimized for medium-term
  - EMA: 8, 21 days (short-term signals)
  - SMA: 50, 200 days (medium/long-term trends)
  - Removed shorter-term MAs (5, 10, 20 days)

- **MACD Configuration**
  - Extended periods: (50,100,20) vs original (12,26,9)
  - Added MACD crossover signal
  - Optimized for medium-term trend detection

- **RSI Improvements**
  - Maintained 14-period RSI
  - Added RSI-MA context feature (RSI extremes with 50-day MA context)

### 2. Training Configuration
- Extended prediction horizon from 30 to 90 days
- Increased historical data from 5y to 10y
- Adjusted minimum data requirement to 200 days
- Updated return thresholds for longer horizon:
  - Strong Buy: >15% (was 6%)
  - Buy: >8% (was 3%)
  - Hold: -8% to 8% (was -3% to 3%)
  - Sell/Strong Sell: <-15% (was -6%)

## Results

### Dataset Statistics
- Previous: 60,359 samples, 46 features
- New: 111,191 samples, 38 features
- Processing success rate: 100% (50/50 tickers)

### Model Performance
- **R² Score**
  - Previous: 0.5948
  - New: 0.7733 (Final model)
  - Cross-validation: 0.7150 ± 0.0145

- **Error Metrics**
  - RMSE: 0.2181 (final model)
  - MAE: 0.1538 ± 0.0015 (cross-validation)
  - Note: Higher absolute errors expected due to longer prediction horizon

### Feature Importance Analysis
Top 10 Features (with importance scores):
1. volatility_60d: 10.24%
2. sma_200: 7.51%
3. sma_50: 7.01%
4. macd: 6.78%
5. bb_middle: 6.34%
6. rsi_ma_context: 6.47%
7. return_20d: 5.02%
8. macd_cross: 3.60%
9. ema_8: 3.23%
10. ema_21: 3.18%

Feature stability score: 0.7816

## Key Insights

1. **Improved Predictive Power**
   - Significant R² improvement from 0.5948 to 0.7733
   - More balanced feature importance distribution
   - Better capture of medium-term trends

2. **Feature Evolution**
   - Longer-term indicators now dominate (SMA 200, SMA 50)
   - 60-day volatility emerged as the strongest predictor
   - RSI-MA context showing good predictive value
   - Extended MACD proving effective for medium-term

3. **Data Quality**
   - Larger dataset improved model robustness
   - No data quality issues or processing errors
   - Good feature stability score

## Areas for Further Investigation

1. **Feature Stability**
   - Current score (0.7816) is below target (0.8)
   - Consider feature selection optimization
   - May need additional composite features

2. **Error Distribution**
   - Analyze error patterns across different market regimes
   - Investigate prediction accuracy in different volatility environments

3. **Potential Improvements**
   - Consider adding volume-based indicators
   - Explore market regime detection
   - Investigate additional momentum features

## Next Steps

1. Monitor model performance on live predictions
2. Consider implementing automated feature selection
3. Investigate adding market regime detection
4. Explore volume-price relationship features
