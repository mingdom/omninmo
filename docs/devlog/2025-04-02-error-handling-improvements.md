# Error Handling Improvements Implementation

**Date**: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This development log documents the implementation of comprehensive error handling improvements in the Folio application. The goal was to create a more robust, maintainable system that properly distinguishes between expected states and actual errors, provides better debugging information, and prevents duplicate log messages.

## Changes Made

### 1. Created Custom Exception Classes

Created a new module `src/folio/exceptions.py` with application-specific exception classes:

```python
class FolioError(Exception):
    """Base class for all Folio application exceptions."""
    pass

class DataError(FolioError):
    """Raised when there are issues with data processing or validation."""
    pass

class PortfolioError(FolioError):
    """Raised when there are issues with portfolio operations."""
    pass

class UIError(FolioError):
    """Raised when there are issues with the UI components."""
    pass

class ConfigurationError(FolioError):
    """Raised when there are issues with application configuration."""
    pass

class StateError(FolioError):
    """Raised when the application is in an invalid state."""
    
    @classmethod
    def no_selection(cls):
        """Create a StateError for the no selection state."""
        return cls("No row selected (normal during initialization)")
    
    @classmethod
    def invalid_row(cls, row, length):
        """Create a StateError for an invalid row index."""
        return cls(f"Row index out of range: {row}, groups length: {length}")
```

### 2. Fixed Logger Configuration

Updated `src/folio/logger.py` to prevent duplicate logs by:

- Configuring the root logger properly
- Disabling propagation for the application logger
- Setting appropriate log levels for different handlers
- Adding better documentation

Key changes:

```python
# Configure root logger to prevent duplicate logs
root_logger = logging.getLogger()
root_logger.setLevel(logging.WARNING)  # Only show warnings and errors from other libraries

# Clear any existing handlers on the root logger
if root_logger.hasHandlers():
    root_logger.handlers.clear()

# Create our application logger
logger = logging.getLogger("folio")
logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
logger.propagate = False  # Prevent propagation to avoid duplicate logs
```

### 3. Created Error Handling Utilities

Created a new module `src/folio/error_utils.py` with utilities for consistent error handling:

- `log_exception`: Function for logging exceptions with consistent formatting
- `handle_callback_error`: Decorator for handling errors in Dash callbacks
- `safe_operation`: Context manager for safely executing operations that might fail

Example of the decorator:

```python
def handle_callback_error(
    default_return: Any = None,
    error_message: str = "Error in callback",
    include_traceback: bool = True,
    log_level: str = "error",
    raise_exception: bool = False
) -> Callable:
    """
    Decorator for handling errors in Dash callbacks.
    """
    def decorator(func: Callable[..., T]) -> Callable[..., T]:
        @functools.wraps(func)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs) -> T:
            try:
                return func(*args, **kwargs)
            except Exception as e:
                # Log the exception
                log_exception(
                    e, 
                    f"{error_message} in {func.__name__}", 
                    include_traceback=include_traceback,
                    level=log_level
                )
                
                # Re-raise if requested
                if raise_exception:
                    raise
                
                # Otherwise return the default value
                return default_return
        return wrapper
    return decorator
```

### 4. Refactored Callback Functions

Updated the callback functions in `src/folio/app.py` to use the new error handling approach:

#### `store_selected_position`

- Added the `@handle_callback_error` decorator
- Refactored to use a helper function for button click handling
- Improved error handling with custom exceptions
- Changed error logging to debug logging for expected states

#### `toggle_position_modal`

- Added the `@handle_callback_error` decorator
- Extracted common functionality into a helper method
- Improved error handling and logging

#### `update_sort_state`

- Added the `@handle_callback_error` decorator
- Added better error handling and logging
- Improved debug messages

## Testing

The changes were tested by:

1. Running the application with `make portfolio`
2. Verifying that the duplicate logs were eliminated
3. Checking that expected states were not logged as errors
4. Verifying that all application functionality continued to work correctly

## Results

The implementation successfully addressed all the identified issues:

1. **Improper Error Classification**: Expected states are now logged at the debug level, not as errors.
2. **Duplicate Log Messages**: The logger configuration changes eliminated duplicate log messages.
3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: The new utilities provide consistent error handling throughout the application.
4. **Missing Stack Traces**: All error logs now include stack traces for better debugging.

## Future Improvements

While this implementation significantly improves error handling, there are still opportunities for further enhancements:

1. **Error Monitoring**: Add centralized error monitoring and reporting.
2. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Improve error messages shown to users.
3. **Automated Testing**: Add automated tests for error handling.
4. **Error Recovery**: Implement automatic recovery from certain types of errors.

## Conclusion

The error handling improvements make the Folio application more robust and maintainable. The logs are now cleaner and more useful for debugging, and the error handling is more consistent throughout the application.
