# Option Delta Testing Implementation

## Overview

Added a comprehensive test function for option delta calculations to validate the Black-Scholes implementation and demonstrate its differences from the previous simplistic approach.

## Test Implementation Details

1. **Created Test Function**: 
   - Implemented `test_option_delta()` in `src/lab/option_utils.py`
   - Uses real option examples from our portfolio

2. **Test Cases**:
   - AAPL APR 17 2025 $220 CALL 
   - AMZN APR 17 2025 $200 CALL
   - AMZN MAY 16 2025 $200 PUT
   - GOOGL MAY 16 2025 $170 CALL
   - GOOGL MAY 16 2025 $150 PUT
   - TSM APR 17 2025 $190 CALL
   - VRT MAY 16 2025 $75 PUT

3. **Testing Parameters**:
   - Tests each option with three different implied volatility levels (20%, 30%, 45%)
   - Uses actual underlying prices from the portfolio
   - Calculates both simple and Black-Scholes deltas for comparison
   - Computes the financial impact (delta exposure) using both methods

## Benefits of the Test Function

1. **Validation**: Confirms the Black-Scholes implementation works correctly with actual portfolio data

2. **Sensitivity Analysis**: Shows how option deltas vary with different implied volatility assumptions

3. **Financial Impact**: Provides concrete numbers showing the potential difference in exposure calculation between simple and proper models

4. **Educational Value**: Serves as a teaching tool to understand how factors like time to expiration, moneyness, and volatility affect option deltas

## Usage

The test function can be run by executing the `option_utils.py` file directly:

```bash
python -m src.lab.option_utils
```

This allows us to quickly check our delta calculations with any new options we add to the portfolio, helping ensure the risk metrics remain accurate.
