# ADX Feature Implementation and Evaluation (March 21, 2024)

## Overview
Implemented the Average Directional Index (ADX) feature as outlined in the feature engineering roadmap. This is the first feature from Phase 2B (Trend Strength Indicators) to be implemented and evaluated.

## Implementation Details

### ADX Feature
Added the `_add_adx` method to the `Features` class in `src/v2/features.py`:

```python
def _add_adx(self, df, period=14):
    """
    Add Average Directional Index (ADX) to measure trend strength
    
    ADX measures trend strength regardless of direction
    Values > 25 indicate strong trend
    """
    # Calculate +DI and -DI
    high_diff = df['High'].diff()
    low_diff = df['Low'].diff().multiply(-1)
    
    plus_dm = (high_diff > low_diff) & (high_diff > 0)
    plus_dm = high_diff.where(plus_dm, 0)
    
    minus_dm = (low_diff > high_diff) & (low_diff > 0)
    minus_dm = low_diff.where(minus_dm, 0)
    
    # Calculate ATR
    tr1 = df['High'] - df['Low']
    tr2 = (df['High'] - df['Close'].shift(1)).abs()
    tr3 = (df['Low'] - df['Close'].shift(1)).abs()
    tr = pd.concat([tr1, tr2, tr3], axis=1).max(axis=1)
    atr = tr.rolling(period).mean()
    
    # Calculate +DI and -DI
    plus_di = 100 * plus_dm.rolling(period).mean() / atr
    minus_di = 100 * minus_dm.rolling(period).mean() / atr
    
    # Calculate DX and ADX
    dx = 100 * (plus_di - minus_di).abs() / (plus_di + minus_di)
    df['adx'] = dx.rolling(period).mean()
    df['adx_trend_strength'] = (df['adx'] > 25).astype(int)
    
    return df
```

Added two new features:
1. `adx`: The Average Directional Index value (continuous)
2. `adx_trend_strength`: Binary indicator (1 if ADX > 25, indicating strong trend)

## Performance Comparison

### Previous Model (31 features)
- Cross-validation R²: 0.6503 ± 0.0216
- Final model R²: 0.7378
- Cross-validation RMSE: 0.2611 ± 0.0069
- Feature stability score: 0.7840

### New Model with ADX (33 features)
- Cross-validation R²: 0.6707 ± 0.0181 (+0.0204)
- Final model R²: 0.7392 (+0.0014)
- Cross-validation RMSE: 0.2535 ± 0.0057 (-0.0076, improved)
- Feature stability score: 0.7727 (-0.0113)

### Top Feature Importance Changes
| Feature | Previous Model | New Model | Change |
|---------|---------------|-----------|--------|
| max_drawdown_90d | 0.1047 | 0.1187 | +0.0140 |
| bb_std | 0.0651 | 0.0875 | +0.0224 |
| sma_50 | 0.0700 | 0.0678 | -0.0022 |
| sma_200 | 0.0603 | 0.0655 | +0.0052 |
| macd | 0.0583 | 0.0613 | +0.0030 |

### ADX Feature Importance
The ADX features did not appear in the top 10 important features, suggesting they may not have as strong a predictive power as initially expected. However, they still contributed to an overall improvement in model performance.

## Analysis

### Improvements
1. **Better Predictive Performance**: The R² improved from 0.6503 to 0.6707 in cross-validation, a 2.04 percentage point increase.
2. **Lower Error**: RMSE decreased from 0.2611 to 0.2535, indicating more accurate predictions.
3. **More Balanced Feature Importance**: The cumulative importance of the top 10 features increased slightly from 0.6067 to 0.6183.

### Concerns
1. **Slight Decrease in Feature Stability**: The stability score decreased from 0.7840 to 0.7727, moving further from our target of >0.8.
2. **ADX Not in Top Features**: The ADX features did not appear in the top 10 important features, suggesting they may need further tuning or may be more valuable in specific market conditions.

## Conclusions

The implementation of the ADX feature has resulted in a modest but meaningful improvement in model performance. The cross-validation R² increased by 2.04 percentage points, which is significant given that we only added two features.

However, the decrease in feature stability is a concern. This suggests that the ADX features may be less stable across different market conditions or time periods compared to our existing features.

## Next Steps

1. **Update Roadmap**: Mark ADX implementation as complete in the feature engineering roadmap.
2. **Proceed with Linear Regression Slope**: Implement the next feature from Phase 2B.
3. **Consider ADX Tuning**: Experiment with different period parameters for ADX calculation to potentially improve its importance and stability.
4. **Monitor Feature Stability**: Continue to track feature stability as we add more features, with the goal of reaching our target of >0.8.
