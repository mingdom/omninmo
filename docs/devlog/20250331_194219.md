# Improved Error Handling in Portfolio Dashboard

## Summary
Implemented robust error handling throughout the folio module, focusing on failing fast for critical errors rather than hiding them through try/except blocks. This change ensures that real issues are immediately surfaced rather than propagating incorrect data.

## Changes Made

1. **DataFetcher Initialization**
   - Now fails immediately if DataFetcher can't be initialized instead of continuing with a null reference
   - Raises a clear RuntimeError with the original exception cause

2. **Stock Position Processing**
   - Added validation for critical data fields before processing
   - Implemented specific exception handlers for common errors (ValueError, TypeError)
   - Improved logging with more context about the specific issue

3. **Option Processing**
   - Added upfront validation for required fields
   - Separated option parsing from calculation in nested try/except blocks for better error localization
   - Added specific exception handling for parsing errors

4. **Portfolio Group Processing**
   - Improved logging for failed portfolio groups with full stack traces
   - Added special handling to prevent continuing with an empty portfolio
   - Will now raise an exception if the first group fails rather than continuing silently

5. **Position Metrics Calculation**
   - Now validates input before processing
   - Removed silent error handling that returned "Error" strings
   - Raises ValueError with clear error messages to prevent misleading UI displays

6. **Button Click Handler**
   - Replaced unsafe `eval()` with JSON parsing
   - Added input validation
   - Implemented specific exception handling for JSON parsing errors
   - Added more context to error logs

## Testing
- All unit tests pass with `make test`
- Dashboard starts successfully with `make portfolio`

## Philosophy
These changes align with our principle of preferring to fail rather than silently continuing with errors. This makes debugging easier and prevents subtle data corruption issues that could lead to incorrect portfolio analysis.

## Next Steps
Consider adding more comprehensive unit tests that specifically test error handling scenarios.
