# Cash Handling Implementation and Testing Log

## Summary

Implemented and tested the cash and cash-like position handling feature according to the [Cash Handling Development Plan](../devplan/2025-04-01-035850-cash-handling.md). Fixed several bugs and added robust unit tests for the functionality.

## Key Changes

1. **Fixed Import Issues**
   - Added missing `create_portfolio_group` import in `utils.py`

2. **Enhanced Beta Calculation**
   - Updated `get_beta` function to properly identify and handle cash and cash-like positions 
   - Added hardcoded check for `SPAXX**` and improved handling of other known cash symbols
   - Used the existing `KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS` set for consistent identification
   - Implemented special handling for API failures with cash-like symbols

3. **Improved Cash Position Handling**
   - Modified `process_portfolio_data` to preserve the original symbol with asterisks for cash positions
   - Added better error handling for cash positions with missing or invalid values
   - Allowed cash positions with zero value to be included in the output

4. **Comprehensive Test Coverage**
   - Added unit tests for `is_cash_like` function
   - Added tests for cash position identification and handling in `process_portfolio_data`
   - Added tests for edge cases (missing values, zero values)
   - Fixed test mock setup to properly handle cash symbols
   - Fixed test assertions to match the actual output structure

## Technical Details

1. The main implementation follows Option 1 from the development plan:
   - Using a predefined `KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS` set for identification
   - Handling missing quantity with `Current Value` for cash positions
   - Assigning beta of 0.0 for cash and cash-like positions
   - Aggregating positions in the portfolio summary

2. Error handling improvements:
   - Added exception handling to safely process invalid currency values
   - Improved error messages for better debugging
   - Special handling for cash positions with zero or missing values

## Results

All tests are now passing, and the cash handling feature is working properly. The feature allows:
- Handling money market funds like `SPAXX**` even with missing quantity
- Correctly identifying low-beta assets like `TLT` and treating them as cash-like
- Properly aggregating cash and cash-like positions in the portfolio summary
- Reporting accurate exposure calculations that include cash positions

This implementation fulfills the requirements specified in the development plan while maintaining backward compatibility with existing code.
