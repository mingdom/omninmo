# Symbol Validation Improvements

## Summary
Implemented a more robust pattern-based approach for validating financial instrument symbols. This replaces the previous hardcoded list-based approach with a more flexible and maintainable regex pattern matching system.

## Changes Made

### Regex Patterns for Symbol Validation
- Added regex patterns to identify valid stock/ETF symbols and option symbols
- Stock/ETF pattern: `r'^[A-Z0-9\.\*]+$'` - matches all uppercase letters with optional numbers and special characters like dots or asterisks
- Option pattern: `r'^-[A-Z0-9]+\d{6}[CP]\d+$'` - matches the standard option format that starts with a dash

### Validation Logic
- Created a comprehensive `is_valid_symbol()` function that checks:
  - Basic symbol format through regex patterns
  - Supporting data (description, quantity, value) to ensure the position is legitimate
  - Special handling for known cash symbols and money market funds
  - Type-specific validation rules (cash, options, stocks)

### Filtering Logic
- Updated the portfolio data processing to use the new validation function
- Logs warnings for invalid symbols with detailed information
- Filters out invalid rows before further processing

### Test Coverage
- Added tests for the `is_valid_symbol()` function with various valid and invalid cases
- Updated existing tests to reflect the new validation approach
- Removed obsolete test that expected numeric symbols to be processed (now correctly filtered)

## Benefits
1. **More Robust**: Can now identify and filter invalid entries based on patterns rather than specific names
2. **Maintainable**: Adding new validation rules doesn't require changing multiple code locations
3. **Better Error Handling**: Provides specific warnings for various types of invalid data
4. **Consistent Treatment**: All validation logic is centralized in one function
5. **Extensible**: Easy to add new patterns or special case handling as needed

## Future Work
- Consider enhancing the option symbol pattern to handle more complex option formats
- Add more logging and diagnostics for edge cases
- Potentially add configuration options to control validation strictness in different environments
