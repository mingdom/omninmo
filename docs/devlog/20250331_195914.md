# Black-Scholes Test Implementation with Pytest

## Overview

Created comprehensive pytest tests for the Black-Scholes option delta calculation to ensure correctness, proper behavior, and compare results with the previous simple delta method.

## Test Implementation

Added a new test file `tests/test_option_delta.py` with the following components:

1. **Fixtures**:
   - `sample_options`: Creates option objects for different scenarios (ATM, ITM, OTM for both calls and puts)
   - `real_option_samples`: Uses actual options data from our portfolio

2. **Tests for Mathematical Correctness**:
   - `test_bs_delta_is_bounded`: Verifies delta values are always between -1 and 1
   - `test_bs_delta_equals_1_for_deep_itm_call`: Confirms deep ITM calls have delta approaching 1
   - `test_bs_delta_near_0_for_deep_otm_call`: Confirms deep OTM calls have delta approaching 0
   - `test_bs_delta_put_call_parity`: Validates that put-call parity holds for delta values

3. **Tests for Position Logic**:
   - `test_bs_delta_negated_for_short_options`: Confirms that short options have negated delta values

4. **Comparison Tests**:
   - `test_bs_delta_vs_simple_delta_real_options`: Compares Black-Scholes vs. simple delta using real portfolio options

5. **Interface Tests**:
   - `test_delta_calculator_interface`: Validates the consistent behavior of the unified calculator interface

## Test Results

All tests pass, confirming the correctness of our Black-Scholes implementation. Key findings:

- Black-Scholes deltas differ significantly from the simple method, especially for OTM options
- The implementation properly handles edge cases (deep ITM/OTM, short positions)
- Mathematical properties like put-call parity are preserved

## Benefits of Proper Testing

1. **Confidence**: We can be confident our delta calculations are mathematically sound
2. **Maintainability**: Future changes to the code can be validated against these tests
3. **Documentation**: The tests serve as documentation for expected behavior
4. **Edge Cases**: Validated behavior in various market conditions and option parameters

## Running the Tests

The tests can be run with:
```bash
python -m pytest tests/test_option_delta.py -v
```

This pytest approach follows the project's standard testing patterns and integrates well with the existing test suite.
