# Linting System Update

## Changes Made
1. Removed mypy type checker from the project:
   - Removed mypy from requirements.txt
   - Removed mypy command from the Makefile lint target

2. Enhanced the `make lint` command:
   - Updated to automatically fix issues using ruff (`--fix` flag)
   - Added `--unsafe-fixes` to apply more automatic fixes
   - Successfully fixed 35 issues automatically

## Testing
- Verified `make test` works correctly after changes
- Confirmed `make portfolio` still functions properly

## Remaining Issues
There are still 9 linting issues that require manual fixing:
- Several "too many return statements" warnings
- "Magic value" comparison warnings (suggesting creating constants)
- One bare except block in `src/lab/portfolio.py`

These issues are non-critical and don't affect functionality.
