# Features Documentation (March 21, 2024)

## Overview
Created comprehensive documentation of the stock prediction system's feature engineering approach, including current features, their evolution, and planned improvements.

## Changes Implemented

### Documentation
- Created `docs/features.md` with detailed explanations of all features
- Organized features into logical categories:
  - Price-based features (returns, moving averages, crossovers)
  - Technical indicators (RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands)
  - Risk metrics (drawdown, Sharpe ratio, stability measures)
- Documented the evolution from Phase 1 (medium-term focus) to Phase 2A (risk-focused)
- Outlined future improvements planned in Phases 2B and 2C

### Key Insights
1. **Feature Evolution**
   - Shift from volatility-based to risk-aware prediction
   - Improved feature stability (0.7816 â†’ 0.7882) with risk metrics
   - max_drawdown_90d emerged as the top feature (10.28% importance)

2. **Current Feature Set Strengths**
   - Balanced mix of technical indicators and risk metrics
   - Medium-term focus with 90-day prediction horizon
   - Risk-adjusted metrics for quality over volatility

3. **Future Direction**
   - Trend strength indicators (ADX, linear regression)
   - Quality metrics (trend consistency, MA compression)
   - Focus on sustainable growth over speculative moves

## Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 2B features (trend strength indicators)
2. Evaluate feature stability with new additions
3. Consider feature selection optimization to reach stability target (>0.8)
4. Explore market regime detection features

## Technical Details
- Documentation file: `docs/features.md`
- Current feature count: 38
- Target feature stability score: >0.8
