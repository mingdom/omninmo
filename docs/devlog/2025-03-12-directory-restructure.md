# 2024-03-14: Directory Restructuring

## Changes Made

1. **Reorganized Log Directories**
   - Moved `training_summaries/` to `logs/training/`
   - Moved `mlruns/` to `logs/mlruns/`
   - Created a centralized `logs/` directory for all logging and run data

## Benefits

1. **Improved Organization**
   - All log-related directories are now centralized under `logs/`
   - Clearer separation between different types of logs
   - More intuitive directory structure

2. **Better Maintainability**
   - Easier to manage backup and cleanup of log files
   - Simplified path management for logging
   - More consistent with standard project layouts

## Technical Details

### Directory Structure Changes
- Created new `logs/` directory structure
- Moved all contents preserving file history
- Updated documentation to reflect new paths

### Affected Components
- Project structure documentation
- Log file paths
- MLflow data location

## Next Steps

1. **Consider**:
   - Adding log rotation policies
   - Implementing automated log cleanup
   - Creating separate development and production log directories

2. **Monitor**:
   - Ensure all components write to correct log locations
   - Verify MLflow continues to function correctly
   - Check for any hardcoded paths that need updating
