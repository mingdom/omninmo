# Black-Scholes Option Delta Implementation

## Overview

Replaced the simplistic option delta calculation with a proper Black-Scholes model implementation to improve the accuracy of portfolio risk assessment.

## Changes Made

1. **Added Black-Scholes Delta Calculation**:
   - Created new `calculate_black_scholes_delta` function in `src/lab/option_utils.py`
   - Implemented formula: Δc = N(d1) for calls, Δp = N(d1) - 1 for puts
   - Properly accounts for time to expiration, volatility, and risk-free rate

2. **Created Unified Delta Interface**:
   - Added `calculate_option_delta` function that can use either the simple method or Black-Scholes
   - Default behavior now uses Black-Scholes with sensible defaults

3. **Updated Calling Code**:
   - Modified `src/folio/utils.py` to use the new delta calculation
   - Updated `src/lab/portfolio.py` to use the new function
   - Added scipy as a dependency for the normal CDF calculations

## Technical Details

The Black-Scholes model for option delta calculation:

- For calls: Δc = N(d1)
- For puts: Δp = N(d1) - 1
- Where:
  - d1 = [ln(S/K) + (r + σ²/2)t] / (σ√t)
  - S = underlying price
  - K = strike price
  - r = risk-free rate
  - σ = implied volatility
  - t = time to expiration in years
  - N() = cumulative normal distribution function

## Default Parameter Values

- **Risk-Free Rate**: 5% (0.05)
- **Implied Volatility**: 30% (0.30)

These defaults can be adjusted based on market conditions.

## Future Improvements

1. **Implied Volatility Estimation**:
   - Currently using a fixed implied volatility for all options
   - Future enhancement would involve calculating IV from market prices

2. **Dynamic Risk-Free Rate**:
   - Pull current risk-free rates from a data source based on option expiry

3. **Additional Greeks**:
   - Add calculations for gamma, theta, and vega
   - Include these in position risk assessments

## Impact

This enhancement significantly improves the accuracy of portfolio risk metrics by:

1. Properly accounting for the time-value component of options
2. Incorporating volatility into calculations
3. Providing more accurate delta values for options of varying moneyness and expiration

The portfolio summary metrics (exposure values, hedging efficiency) are now based on more realistic option sensitivity values.
