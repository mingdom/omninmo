# omninmo MVP Development Progress (updated Feb-28-2025)

## What We've Accomplished

1. **Project Structure Setup**:
   - Created a well-organized project structure with separate modules for data, models, utils, and app
   - Added __init__.py files to make the directories proper Python packages

2. **Core Functionality Implementation**:
   - **Data Module**: Implemented StockDataFetcher for retrieving stock data using yfinance
   - **Feature Engineering**: Created FeatureEngineer for calculating technical indicators
   - **Prediction Model**: Developed StockRatingPredictor using RandomForest for stock rating predictions
   - **Analysis Utilities**: Built visualization and analysis tools for stock data

3. **Application Interface**:
   - Developed a Streamlit web application with an intuitive user interface
   - Implemented interactive charts using Plotly
   - Created a rating display system with color-coded indicators

4. **Supporting Scripts**:
   - Created run_app.py for launching the Streamlit app
   - Implemented train_model.py for pre-training the model
   - Added test_model.py for evaluating model performance
   - Developed predict_ticker.py for quick command-line predictions

5. **Documentation**:
   - Created comprehensive documentation in the docs/ folder
   - Documented the architecture, setup process, and usage instructions

6. **Testing**:
   - Added test_imports.py to verify that all imports work correctly
   - Created test_trainer.py to specifically test the train_on_default_tickers function
   - Implemented run_tests.py to run all tests

7. **Build System**:
   - Created a Makefile with targets for common operations
   - Added virtual environment setup and management
   - Ensured consistent use of python3 and pip3 throughout the project

## What's Remaining

1. **Dependency Issues**:
   -[x] Need to install missing dependencies (tqdm)
   -[x] Resolve import issues with train_on_default_tickers function
   -[x] Set up proper virtual environment management

2. **Testing and Debugging**:
   - Complete end-to-end testing of the application
   - Fix any runtime errors that occur during execution

3. **Model Training**:
   - Train the initial model with default tickers
   - Validate model performance with test data

4. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Ensure the application runs correctly in different environments
   - Add error handling for edge cases

## Next Steps

1. Set up the virtual environment:
   ```
   make env
   source activate-venv.sh
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   make install
   ```

3. Run the tests to verify that the import issues are resolved:
   ```
   make test
   ```

4. Train the initial model:
   ```
   make train
   ```

5. Run the application:
   ```
   make run
   ```

6. Test the model with sample tickers:
   ```
   make predict TICKER=AAPL
   ```

The MVP is nearly complete, with the core functionality implemented. The remaining tasks are primarily focused on testing and ensuring the application runs smoothly.
