# Project Progress

## Change Logs
- Simplified the test structure by focusing on core functionality tests.
- Moved all test scripts to the `tests` directory for better organization.
- Created core test files:
  - `test_core.py`: Tests core application components like data fetching, feature engineering, and watchlist analysis.
  - `test_model_functionality.py`: Tests model training, loading, and prediction functionality.
- Updated the Makefile to reflect the new test structure and ensure it runs the correct tests.
- Updated the `run-pipeline.sh` script to use the new test structure.
- Removed old test scripts from the `scripts` directory that were moved to the `tests` directory.
- Moved standalone Python scripts from the root directory to the `scripts` directory.
- Organized sample JSON response files by moving them from the root directory to `data/samples/`.
- Consolidated cache directories by moving content from `data/cache` to the main `cache` directory.
- Removed unnecessary files like `package.json` and TypeScript files that were not relevant to this Python project.
- Successfully ran all tests to ensure everything is functioning correctly.

## Remaining Tasks
- Address warnings related to deprecated methods and library compatibility (e.g., `Styler.applymap` deprecation and `NotOpenSSLWarning`).
- Verify that the model training process is robust and that the fallback to `sklearn's GradientBoostingClassifier` is intentional and documented.
- Update documentation to reflect the changes in the test structure and any new processes.
- Consider additional tests for any new features or critical paths that may not be covered by the current tests.
