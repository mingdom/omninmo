# Master list of things we should address
- Compare different models for technical analysis
- Multi-model, different length of time... etc.
- Train should output top 30 most useful features
- Figure out how to tune the model iteratively
- I wonder if we can have one model predict price and another predict drawdown?
- Some way to measure beta vs SPY in the stocks?


Log:
- Cursor totally failed at doing a refactor to remove a flag. Maybe try this in vscode with augment next?
- I was able to achieve this in Augment.
- Augment also fixed caching for me
- Config stuff
- Make log level configurable and its own yaml

### Feature prompt
can you read through the feature engineering roadmap and cross-check the plan against the current implementation and then create an updated roadmap?

use thinking to figure out what has already been completed and which next features will give us the next bang for the buck.
