# Master list of things we should address
- Confidence not really useful
- Datetime of logs
- Unnecessary flags
- Don't put the .env file in git


Log:
- Cursor totally failed at doing a refactor to remove a flag. Maybe try this in vscode with augment next?
- I was able to achieve this in Augment.
- Augment also fixed caching for me
