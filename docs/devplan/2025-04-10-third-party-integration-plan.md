- Established in the quantitative finance community

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Add optional integration with pyfolio for advanced analytics
2. Create exportable reports using pyfolio's tear sheets
3. Add historical performance tracking using pyfolio's tools

## 2. Code Complexity Reduction

### 2.1 Option Calculation Refactoring

**Current Issues:**
- Complex, custom implementation of Black-Scholes in `option_utils.py`
- Multiple fallback methods for implied volatility calculation
- Redundant error handling and edge case management
- Excessive comments explaining financial concepts

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Replace with QuantLib for all option calculations
2. Simplify the API to focus on the core use cases
3. Move complex edge case handling to the library
4. Reduce code size by ~70% in `option_utils.py`

### 2.2 Portfolio Processing Simplification

**Current Issues:**
- Overly complex portfolio processing in `portfolio.py`
- Nested try/except blocks creating difficult-to-follow code paths
- Redundant data transformation between different formats
- Manual handling of cash-like positions

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Refactor `process_portfolio_data` into smaller, focused functions
2. Simplify error handling with more specific exception types
3. Create a cleaner data pipeline with fewer transformations
4. Standardize cash handling across the application

### 2.3 Data Model Consolidation

**Current Issues:**
- Redundant properties and backward compatibility code
- Parallel class and dictionary type definitions
- Complex serialization/deserialization logic
- Inconsistent naming conventions (market_value vs. market_exposure)

**Proposed Solution:**
1. Simplify the data model by removing deprecated properties
2. Consolidate type definitions
3. Use dataclasses more effectively
4. Standardize on consistent naming conventions

## 3. Integration with Existing Portfolio Analysis Tools

### 3.1 OpenBB Terminal Integration

[OpenBB Terminal](https://openbb.co/) is an open-source investment research platform that could provide:
- Advanced data sources beyond yfinance
- Fundamental analysis capabilities
- Alternative data integration
- Extensive charting and visualization

**Benefits:**
- Access to a wide range of financial data
- Professional-grade analysis tools
- Active open-source community

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Create an adapter for OpenBB's SDK
2. Add data source options for OpenBB
3. Integrate OpenBB's visualization capabilities

### 3.2 Pandas-TA Integration

[Pandas-TA](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta) is a technical analysis library that could add:
- Technical indicators
- Chart pattern recognition
- Trend analysis
- Signal generation

**Benefits:**
- Enhance analysis with technical indicators
- Add pattern recognition capabilities
- Provide trading signals based on technical analysis

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Add technical analysis module using pandas-ta
2. Create visualization components for technical indicators
3. Add signal generation capabilities for portfolio positions

## 4. Implementation Priorities

### 5.2 Maintainability Burden Assessment

| Module | Lines of Code | Complexity | Maintainability Burden | Priority |
|--------|--------------|------------|------------------------|----------|
| option_utils.py | 1022 | High | High | 1 |
| portfolio.py | 1342 | High | High | 1 |
| data_model.py | 1101 | Medium | Medium | 2 |
| app.py | 1223 | Medium | Medium | 3 |
| chart_data.py | ~500 | Medium | Medium | 3 |
| components/*.py | ~1000 | Low | Low | 4 |

## 6. Conclusion

By integrating established third-party libraries and reducing code complexity, we can:
1. Improve the reliability of financial calculations
