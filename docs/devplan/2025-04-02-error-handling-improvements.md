# Error Handling Improvements

**Date**: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This development plan outlines a comprehensive approach to improving error handling throughout the Folio application. The goal is to create a more robust, maintainable system that properly distinguishes between expected states and actual errors, provides better debugging information, and prevents duplicate log messages.

## Current Issues

1. **Improper Error Classification**: The application logs expected states (like no table selection during initialization) as errors, creating unnecessary noise in the logs.

2. **Duplicate Log Messages**: The same messages appear twice in the logs, once with and once without the "folio:" prefix, making logs harder to read.

3. **Inconsistent Error Handling**: Different parts of the application handle errors in different ways, with varying levels of detail and context.

4. **Missing Stack Traces**: Some error logs don't include stack traces, making debugging more difficult.

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Create Custom Exception Classes

Create a new module `src/folio/exceptions.py` with application-specific exception classes:

- `FolioError`: Base class for all application exceptions
- `DataError`: For data processing or validation issues
- `PortfolioError`: For portfolio operations issues
- `UIError`: For UI component issues
- `ConfigurationError`: For application configuration issues
- `StateError`: For application state issues, with factory methods for common cases

### 2. Fix Logger Configuration

Update `src/folio/logger.py` to prevent duplicate logs by:

- Configuring the root logger properly
- Disabling propagation for the application logger
- Setting appropriate log levels for different handlers
- Adding better documentation

### 3. Create Error Handling Utilities

Create a new module `src/folio/error_utils.py` with utilities for consistent error handling:

- `log_exception`: Function for logging exceptions with consistent formatting
- `handle_callback_error`: Decorator for handling errors in Dash callbacks
- `safe_operation`: Context manager for safely executing operations that might fail

### 4. Refactor Callback Functions

Update the callback functions in `src/folio/app.py` to use the new error handling approach:

- `store_selected_position`: Use the decorator and custom exceptions
- `toggle_position_modal`: Extract common functionality into helper methods
- `update_sort_state`: Add better error handling and logging

### 5. Update Best Practices

Update `BEST_PRACTICES.md` to include guidance on:

- Distinguishing between expected states and actual errors
- Including stack traces for unexpected errors
- Using appropriate log levels
- Using the new error handling utilities

## Testing Plan

1. **Verify Log Output**: Ensure that duplicate logs are eliminated and that expected states are not logged as errors.

2. **Test Error Handling**: Verify that errors are properly caught, logged, and handled.

3. **Check Stack Traces**: Ensure that stack traces are included in error logs for better debugging.

4. **Verify Functionality**: Ensure that all application functionality continues to work correctly.

## Success Criteria

1. **Cleaner Logs**: Logs should be cleaner, with no duplicate messages and proper log levels.

2. **Better Error Information**: Error logs should include stack traces and context for better debugging.

3. **Consistent Handling**: Error handling should be consistent throughout the application.

4. **Maintained Functionality**: All application functionality should continue to work correctly.

## Future Improvements

1. **Error Monitoring**: Add centralized error monitoring and reporting.

2. **User-Friendly Error Messages**: Improve error messages shown to users.

3. **Automated Testing**: Add automated tests for error handling.

4. **Error Recovery**: Implement automatic recovery from certain types of errors.
