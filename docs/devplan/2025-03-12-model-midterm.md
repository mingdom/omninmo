# Improving Medium-Term (90-180 Day) Market Trend Predictions

## Current Limitations
- Most technical indicators are optimized for short-term predictions (days to weeks)
- Standard momentum and trend indicators may not capture longer cycles effectively
- Volatility over longer periods requires different handling

## Proposed Feature Enhancements

### 1. Long-Term Technical Indicators
- **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**
  - Extend the standard periods (12,26,9) to (50,100,20) for longer-term trend detection
  - Add a 200-day variation to capture major trend changes

- **Enhanced Moving Averages**
  - Implement Hull Moving Average (HMA) with 90 and 180-day periods
  - Add Weighted Moving Average (WMA) with emphasis on recent data but longer lookback

### 2. Cycle-Based Indicators
- **Implement Cycle Analysis**
  - Add Time Cycle analysis using Fourier Transforms
  - Include seasonality detection for 90/180 day patterns
  - Consider implementing Hurst Exponent to measure long-term dependence

- **Market Regime Detection**
  - Add Hidden Markov Models for market regime classification
  - Implement regime-specific feature weightings

### 3. Volatility and Risk Metrics
- **Enhanced Volatility Measures**
  - Implement GARCH models for long-term volatility forecasting
  - Add rolling volatility with 90/180 day windows
  - Include volatility regime classification

### 4. Fundamental Features
- **Economic Indicators**
  - Quarterly GDP growth rates
  - Monthly inflation metrics
  - Interest rate trends and yield curve data

- **Market Sentiment**
  - Long-term sentiment indicators
  - Institutional flow metrics
  - Options market put/call ratios with longer expiries

## Implementation Plan

1. **Phase 1: Core Technical Indicators**
   - Implement extended MACD
   - Add long-term moving averages
   - Develop cycle analysis features

2. **Phase 2: Advanced Features**
   - Implement regime detection
   - Add volatility modeling
   - Integrate fundamental features

3. **Phase 3: Validation and Optimization**
   - Backtest on historical 90-180 day periods
   - Optimize feature weights for medium-term predictions
   - Cross-validate across different market regimes

## Expected Improvements
- Better capture of medium-term market cycles
- Reduced noise from short-term fluctuations
- Improved regime-specific predictions
- More robust performance across different market conditions

## Risks and Mitigations
- **Overfitting**: Use strict cross-validation with non-overlapping periods
- **Look-ahead Bias**: Ensure all features use proper time-series cross validation
- **Computational Cost**: Implement efficient calculations for longer time windows

## Next Steps
1. Implement Phase 1 features
2. Create validation framework for medium-term predictions
3. Begin collecting additional fundamental data
4. Develop backtesting framework for 90-180 day predictions
