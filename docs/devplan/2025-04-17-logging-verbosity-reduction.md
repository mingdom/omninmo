## Overview

This development plan outlines a strategy to reduce the verbosity of logs in the Folio application by adjusting the log levels of various messages. The goal is to make the INFO and higher log levels less spammy while preserving important information for troubleshooting and monitoring.

## Current State

The application currently uses the following logging configuration:

1. **Log Level Configuration**: 
   - The application already supports configuring log levels via the `LOG_LEVEL` environment variable
   - Default level is INFO for normal environments, WARNING for Hugging Face
   - File logging is set to DEBUG level, capturing all messages

2. **Current Log Patterns**:
   - Many routine operations are logged at INFO level
   - Detailed data processing steps are logged at INFO level
   - Callback registrations and executions are logged at INFO level
   - Calculation details are logged at INFO level

3. **Issues**:
   - INFO logs are too verbose, making it difficult to identify important information
   - Many routine operations don't need to be at INFO level
   - Log files grow large quickly due to excessive INFO messages

## Proposed Changes

### 1. Adjust Log Levels

Change the following types of logs from INFO to DEBUG:

1. **Application Initialization**:
   - Component initialization messages
   - Configuration loading details
   - Callback registration messages

2. **Routine Operations**:
   - Regular callback executions
   - Standard data processing steps
   - Calculation details for normal operations

3. **Detailed Data Processing**:
   - Portfolio statistics and breakdowns
   - Detailed calculation steps
   - Routine data transformations

### 2. Maintain INFO Level for Important Events

Keep the following types of logs at INFO level:

1. **Application State**:
   - Application startup and shutdown
   - Server URL and access information

2. **Critical User Actions**:
   - File uploads and processing results
   - Major user-initiated actions

3. **Important State Changes**:
   - Successful portfolio data loading
   - Significant data updates

4. **Summary Information**:
   - High-level portfolio processing results
   - Important calculation summaries

### 3. Specific Files to Modify

The following files contain logging statements that need to be adjusted:

1. `src/folio/app.py`: Adjust initialization and callback logs
2. `src/folio/portfolio.py`: Change detailed processing logs to DEBUG
3. `src/folio/components/charts.py`: Adjust chart creation and update logs
4. `src/folio/components/summary_cards.py`: Change routine update logs to DEBUG
5. `src/folio/components/pnl_chart.py`: Adjust calculation detail logs
6. Other component files with similar logging patterns

## Implementation Approach

1. **Systematic Review**:
   - Review each file systematically
   - Identify INFO logs that can be changed to DEBUG
   - Preserve INFO logs for important events

2. **Consistent Patterns**:
   - Apply consistent patterns across similar components
   - Use DEBUG for routine operations
   - Use INFO for significant events
   - Use WARNING for potential issues
   - Use ERROR for actual errors

3. **Testing**:
   - Test with different log levels to ensure appropriate visibility
   - Verify that important information is still visible at INFO level
   - Check that DEBUG level provides detailed troubleshooting information

## Expected Benefits

1. **Cleaner Logs**: INFO and higher logs will be less cluttered
2. **Better Signal-to-Noise Ratio**: Important events will stand out more clearly
3. **Smaller Log Files**: Log files will be smaller when running at INFO level
4. **Preserved Debugging Capability**: All detailed information still available at DEBUG level

## Compatibility and Risks

1. **Compatibility**:
   - These changes are compatible with the existing logging configuration
   - No changes to the logging infrastructure are needed
   - Users can still adjust verbosity via the LOG_LEVEL environment variable

2. **Risks**:
   - Low risk as this only affects log verbosity, not application functionality
   - Some information might be less visible by default, but can be accessed by setting LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG

## Future Improvements

1. **Configuration File Integration**:
   - Integrate with the `folio.yaml` configuration file for log level settings
   - Currently, the configuration file has logging settings but they aren't used

2. **Component-Level Log Control**:
   - Consider allowing different log levels for different components
   - This would enable more granular control over logging verbosity

3. **Log Rotation**:
   - Implement log rotation for log files to manage disk space better
   - Currently, log files are overwritten on each run

## Conclusion

This plan provides a systematic approach to reducing log verbosity while maintaining the ability to access detailed information when needed. By adjusting log levels appropriately, we can improve the signal-to-noise ratio in logs and make the application easier to monitor and troubleshoot.
