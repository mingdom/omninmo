# Dev Plan: Handling Cash and Short-Term Positions (2025-04-01)

## Goal

Refactor the portfolio processing logic to correctly identify, handle, and display cash, money market funds, bond funds/ETFs, and other short-term, low-beta assets. Ensure these positions are aggregated and displayed appropriately in the application, even when quantity information is missing (e.g., `SPAXX`).

## Background

Currently, the application processes portfolio data from a CSV file. 
- Positions like `SPAXX` are skipped because they lack a 'Quantity'.
- Other low-beta assets like bond funds (`FFRHX`) or ETFs (`TLT`) might have their beta calculated via API, which is unnecessary and potentially inaccurate for their purpose (should be near zero).
- Money market funds (`FMPXX`) are handled correctly by description check in `get_beta`.
- There's no distinct category for these assets in the final display.

## Proposed Solution

Modify `src/folio/utils.py` and potentially related data structures/display components.

### Option 1: Enhanced `process_portfolio_data` Logic (Recommended)

1.  **Identify Cash-like Assets:**
    *   In `process_portfolio_data`, add logic to identify cash-like assets *before* checking for quantity.
    *   Identification criteria (combine these):
        *   `Type == 'Cash'` (from CSV)
        *   `'MONEY MARKET'` in `Description` (from CSV)
        *   Symbol is in a predefined, *configurable* set of known cash, money market, bond fund/ETF symbols (e.g., `KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS = {'SPAXX**', 'FMPXX', 'FFRHX', 'TLT', 'SHY', 'BIL', ...}`).
        *   *(Self-correction based on check_beta.py: API fetch often fails for money markets, confirming the need for explicit rules.)*
2.  **Handle Missing Quantity:**
    *   If an asset is identified as cash-like (by the above criteria) and `Quantity` is missing, invalid, or zero, attempt to use `Current Value` directly.
    *   Clean the `Current Value` string using `clean_currency_value`.
    *   Log a warning if `Current Value` is also missing or invalid.
3.  **Assign Zero Beta (Crucial):**
    *   Modify `get_beta`:
        *   Add checks *at the beginning* for `ticker in KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS` or `'MONEY MARKET' in description`.
        *   If matched, log the reason and **return 0.0 immediately**, skipping the API call.
        *   *(Self-correction based on check_beta.py: Actual calculated betas for bonds like TLT/SHY/BIL/FFRHX are very close to zero, validating the decision to force them to 0.0 via these rules.)*
    *   Ensure that within `process_portfolio_data`, assets identified as cash-like *always* have their beta recorded as 0.0, regardless of whether `get_beta` was called or skipped.
4.  **Aggregate into a New Category:**
    *   Modify `process_portfolio_data` to accumulate the total *cleaned* value (`Current Value` or calculated) of these cash-like assets.
    *   Introduce a new field in the summary output (or a dedicated `CashPosition` object) to store this aggregated value and count.
    *   Ensure duplicate entries (like `TLT` appearing in both `Cash` and `Margin`) are handled correctly (likely sum their values).
5.  **Update Application Display:**
    *   Modify the relevant application components (e.g., in `app.py` or templates) to display this new "Cash & Short-Term" category summary, showing the total value. These positions will *not* appear in the main stock/option tables.

### Option 2: Pre-processing Step

1.  Introduce a separate function *before* `process_portfolio_data` that specifically scans the DataFrame for cash-like assets.
2.  This function identifies, aggregates their value, and removes them from the main DataFrame.
3.  The aggregated cash value is passed separately to `process_portfolio_data` or merged into its summary output.
4.  `process_portfolio_data` then works only on the remaining stock/option positions.
5.  Requires similar updates to `get_beta` and application display as Option 1.
    *   *Pro:* Cleaner separation of concerns.
    *   *Con:* Adds another layer of processing; might complicate data flow.

## Implementation Steps (Following Option 1)

1.  **(Config/Constants)** Define the `KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS` set (e.g., in a constants file or loaded from config).
2.  **(utils.py - get_beta)** Add the initial checks for description (`'MONEY MARKET'`) and `ticker in KNOWN_CASH_SYMBOLS`. Return 0.0 immediately if matched.
3.  **(utils.py - process_portfolio_data)**
    *   Define a helper function `is_cash_like(row, known_symbols)` or add logic directly in the loop.
    *   Check `row['Type'] == 'Cash'` OR `'MONEY MARKET' in row['Description']` OR `row['Symbol'] in known_symbols`.
    *   If `is_cash_like`:
        *   Get value: Try cleaning `row['Current Value']`. If it fails or quantity is valid, calculate `quantity * price` as fallback/alternative.
        *   Add the determined value to a running `cash_total`.
        *   Store relevant info (symbol, description, value) in a `cash_positions` list/dict.
        *   Ensure beta for this item is recorded as 0.0 in any internal tracking.
        *   *Continue* to the next row (skip stock/option processing for this row).
4.  **(utils.py - process_portfolio_data)** Update the return value/structure to include `cash_summary` (e.g., `{'total_value': cash_total, 'count': cash_count, 'positions': cash_positions_list}`). Ensure the main `portfolio_summary` excludes these cash values from its totals.
5.  **(app.py/templates)** Update the UI to display the new cash category summary.
6.  **Testing:**
    *   Update `tests/test_utils.py`:
        *   Uncomment and confirm the tests for `FFRHX`, `TLT`, `SHY`, `BIL` now pass (expecting 0.0 from the modified `get_beta`).
        *   Add tests ensuring `get_beta` correctly handles `SPAXX**` and `FMPXX` (returning 0.0) *without* needing the mock `DataFetcher` to return data for them.
    *   Add unit tests for `process_portfolio_data` using sample CSV data, specifically verifying:
        *   `SPAXX` is included in the cash summary using its `Current Value`.
        *   `FMPXX`, `FFRHX`, `TLT` are aggregated into the cash summary with beta 0.0.
        *   Duplicate `TLT` entries are summed correctly within the cash summary.
        *   Cash values are excluded from the main stock/option summary totals.

## Future Considerations

-   Make the list of cash/bond symbols configurable.
-   Allow user overrides for beta values.
-   Potentially distinguish between pure cash, money market, and short-term bonds in the summary.

## Test Plan

Based on testing best practices (unit tests first, focus on core logic, test edges/errors), the following tests should be added or updated:

**1. `test_utils.py` (`get_beta` function):**
    - **Test Explicit Zero Beta Cases:**
        - `test_get_beta_spaxx`: Input `ticker='SPAXX**'`, assert returns `0.0`. Mock `DataFetcher` to ensure no API call is made.
        - `test_get_beta_money_market`: Input `description='FIDELITY GOVT MONEY MARKET'`, assert returns `0.0`. Mock `DataFetcher` to ensure no API call is made.
    - **Test API Skipping:** Ensure that for the above cases, the mock `DataFetcher.fetch_data` and `fetch_market_data` methods are *not* called.
    - **Test Calculated Beta (Existing):** Ensure existing tests for standard tickers (e.g., `AAPL`, `GOOGL`) still pass.
    - **Test Low Beta Calculation:** Add a test for a symbol known to have low beta (e.g., `BIL` based on `check_beta.py` results) using mock data, assert it returns a value close to the expected low beta (e.g., `abs(beta) < 0.1`).
    - **Test Error Handling (Existing):** Ensure existing tests for `DataFetcher` failures or invalid data still raise the correct exceptions.

**2. `test_utils.py` (`process_portfolio_data` function):**
    - **Setup:** Use `pytest` fixtures to create sample `pd.DataFrame` inputs representing various scenarios.
    - **Test Pure Cash Handling (`SPAXX`):**
        - Input DataFrame with `SPAXX**`, no `Quantity`, but valid `Current Value`.
        - Assert `SPAXX**` appears in `summary.cash_positions` with `is_cash_like=False` and correct `market_value`.
        - Assert `SPAXX**` does *not* appear in the returned `groups` list.
        - Assert `summary.total_cash` includes the `SPAXX**` value.
    - **Test Other Cash Types (`Type='CASH'`, `Description='MONEY MARKET'`):**
        - Input DataFrame with rows matching these criteria.
        - Assert they are correctly added to `summary.cash_positions` with `is_cash_like=False`.
        - Assert `summary.total_cash` reflects their values.
    - **Test Cash-Like Handling (Low Beta):**
        - Input DataFrame with a low-beta stock (e.g., `BIL`). Mock `get_beta` to return `< 0.1` for `BIL`.
        - Assert `BIL` appears in `summary.cash_positions` with `is_cash_like=True` and correct `market_value`.
        - Assert `BIL` does *not* appear in the returned `groups` list.
        - Assert `summary.total_cash_like` includes the `BIL` value.
    - **Test Standard Stock/Option Handling:**
        - Input DataFrame with a mix of cash, cash-like, standard stocks, and options.
        - Assert standard stocks/options are correctly processed into `groups`.
        - Assert cash/cash-like positions are *excluded* from `groups`.
    - **Test Summary Calculations:**
        - Assert `summary.portfolio_beta` is calculated correctly, weighted only by the non-cash positions.
        - Assert `summary.total_value_net` includes contributions from `groups`, `total_cash`, and `total_cash_like`.
        - Assert `summary.long_exposure.components` correctly shows 'Cash' and 'Cash-Like' values.
    - **Test Edge Cases:**
        - Input with only cash positions.
        - Input with cash position missing `Current Value` (should be skipped or handled gracefully based on implementation).
        - Input with duplicate cash symbols (ensure aggregation if needed, though current logic processes row by row).

**3. `test_app.py` (Callbacks - Integration-light):**
    - **Test `update_summary_cards`:**
        - Provide sample `summary_data` (as dict) including `cash_positions`, `total_cash`, `total_cash_like`.
        - Assert the callback returns the correctly formatted strings for the cash-related outputs (`total-cash`, `total-cash-like`, `cash-percentage`).
    - **Test `update_portfolio_table`:**
        - Provide sample `groups_data` and `summary_data` (including cash positions as dicts).
        - Call the underlying `create_portfolio_table` function directly (or test the callback output).
        - Assert that `create_portfolio_table` receives a list of `CashPosition` objects.
        - Assert the output contains rows corresponding to both groups and cash positions.
    - **Test `toggle_position_modal`:**
        - Provide sample `summary_data` (with cash) and trigger the callback with `position_data` representing a cash position (dict with `position_type='cash'`).
        - Assert the modal opens (`True`) and the body contains output from `create_position_details` called with a `CashPosition` object.

**4. `test_components.py` (UI Logic - Unit):**
    - **Test `create_portfolio_table`:**
        - Call directly with sample `groups` and `cash_positions`.
        - Assert the returned `html.Div` contains distinct rows for cash/cash-like positions with correct text/formatting.
        - Test sorting logic (`value`, `type`, `ticker`) with a mix of cash and group rows, asserting the order of `all_rows` is correct before rendering.
    - **Test `create_position_details`:**
        - Call directly with a sample `CashPosition` object.
        - Assert the returned `html.Div` contains the specific cash section with correct details.

This plan focuses testing on the data transformation (`utils.py`), the data structures (`data_model.py`), and the core logic within callbacks and components that handle the new cash types, providing good coverage without excessive UI simulation.
