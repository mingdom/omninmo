Title: Fundamental Data Integration into Stock Rating Tool - DevPlan

Date: 2025-03-21

Overview:
Our current stock rating tool tends to favor stocks with explosive technical run-ups (e.g., PLTR with a P/S ratio near 100) due to its reliance on technical indicators. This plan outlines a strategy to integrate fundamental data to create a more balanced evaluation system that properly accounts for valuation, growth, and profitability metrics.

Objectives:
1. Develop a multi-faceted scoring system that balances technical signals with fundamental health
2. Reduce bias toward overvalued momentum stocks with unsustainable fundamentals
3. Create modular model architecture to support different weighting schemes across market conditions

Proposed Fundamental Metrics:

1. Valuation Metrics:
   - Forward P/E relative to sector/industry average
   - P/S ratio with industry context
   - EV/EBITDA with historical and sector comparisons
   - Price-to-Free Cash Flow
   - PEG ratio (P/E relative to growth)

2. Growth Metrics:
   - Revenue growth rate (1-year, 3-year, 5-year)
   - EPS growth trends and acceleration/deceleration
   - Revenue growth stability (variance over time)
   - R&D as percentage of revenue (for appropriate sectors)

3. Profitability Metrics:
   - Gross margin and trend
   - Operating margin and trend
   - ROE and ROIC with sector context
   - Free cash flow conversion
   - Debt-to-EBITDA ratio

4. Quality Metrics:
   - Balance sheet strength
   - Earnings quality indicators
   - Management efficiency metrics
   - Insider ownership and recent transactions

Data Acquisition & Processing:
- Primary data sources: Financial APIs with reliable fundamental data (e.g., Alpha Vantage, IEX Cloud, Polygon.io)
- Secondary validation: Cross-reference data points across multiple providers to ensure accuracy
- Historical data: Minimum 5-year history for trend analysis
- Storage: Structured database with regular automated updates and version tracking
- Handling missing data: Sector-specific imputation strategies where appropriate

Modeling Approach (Hybrid System):

Component 1: Sector-Specific Fundamental Scoring
- Develop sector-specific scoring models that account for industry characteristics
- Normalize metrics against sector peers rather than market-wide
- Weight metrics differently by sector (e.g., P/S more relevant for software, P/E for financials)

Component 2: Technical Momentum Analysis
- Maintain existing technical indicators but with adjusted weighting
- Include volume analysis to validate price movements
- Add volatility adjustment factors

Component 3: Combined Scoring System
- Weighted ensemble approach that dynamically adjusts factor importance
- Introduce market regime detection to modify weights based on prevailing conditions
- Implement guardrails to prevent extreme scores based on single factors

Implementation Architecture:
1. Data Layer:
   - Data ingestion microservice with API integrations
   - Data validation and quality monitoring tools
   - Automated refresh with configurable schedule by data type

2. Processing Layer:
   - Feature engineering pipeline with sector-specific normalization
   - Data transformation service for model consumption
   - Caching system for frequently accessed metrics

3. Model Layer:
   - Separate model instances for technical and fundamental analysis
   - Ensemble orchestrator for combined scoring
   - Model monitoring for drift detection

4. Presentation Layer:
   - Score breakdown visualization showing technical vs. fundamental contributions
   - Comparison tools for peer analysis
   - Warning indicators for extremes in individual metrics

Implementation Roadmap:
1. Phase 1 (2 weeks): Data source selection and initial API integration
2. Phase 2 (3 weeks): Feature engineering and data pipeline development
3. Phase 3 (4 weeks): Model development and initial calibration
4. Phase 4 (2 weeks): Integration with existing technical scoring system
5. Phase 5 (3 weeks): Backtesting against historical data with adjustments
6. Phase 6 (2 weeks): UI integration and visualization development
7. Phase 7 (Ongoing): Performance monitoring and model refinement

Risk Assessment:
- Data Quality: Implement data monitoring with alerts for anomalies and inconsistencies
- Model Complexity: Use interpretability tools to maintain transparency in scoring
- Market Adaptability: Regular backtesting during different market regimes to ensure robustness
- Transition Risk: Phase in new scoring gradually with side-by-side comparison to current system

Success Metrics:
- Reduced bias toward high P/S stocks without fundamental support
- Improved predictive power across full market cycles
- Better performance during market regime transitions
- Higher user engagement with fundamental metrics
- Reduced volatility in portfolio recommendations

Future Enhancements:
- Alternative data integration (e.g., sentiment analysis, ESG factors)
- Macroeconomic factor adjustments
- Sub-industry specialization models
- Custom weighting profiles for different investment strategies

Conclusion:
This fundamental data integration plan creates a more balanced stock rating system that maintains the strengths of our technical analysis while adding crucial value and quality assessment. By implementing a modular, sector-aware approach, we can significantly improve the quality of recommendations across different market conditions while avoiding the pitfalls of overly focusing on recent momentum at the expense of valuation discipline.
