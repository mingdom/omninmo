# MA Compression/Expansion Implementation Plan

## Overview
The Moving Average Compression/Expansion feature measures the spacing between moving averages to identify potential breakout opportunities and market regime changes. Tight compression often precedes strong moves, while expansion indicates an established trend.

## Feature Details

### Purpose
- Identify potential breakout opportunities
- Detect market regime changes
- Provide early signals for volatility expansion
- Reduce false trend signals during compression periods

### Technical Background
Moving average compression/expansion analysis is based on the concept that:
- Moving averages tend to converge during consolidation periods
- Extreme compression often precedes significant price moves
- Expansion indicates an established trend
- The relationship between short-term and long-term MA spacing provides context
- Historical compression extremes are particularly significant

## Implementation Details

### New Features
- `ma_dist_8_21`: Distance between 8-day and 21-day EMAs (normalized)
- `ma_dist_50_200`: Distance between 50-day and 200-day SMAs (normalized)
- `ma_compression_ratio`: Ratio of short-term to long-term MA distances
- `ma_compressed`: Binary indicator for extreme compression events

### Code Implementation
```python
def _add_ma_compression(self, df):
    """Add Moving Average Compression/Expansion features"""
    # Calculate distances between key MAs
    df['ma_dist_8_21'] = (df['ema_8'] - df['ema_21']).abs() / df['Close'] * 100
    df['ma_dist_50_200'] = (df['sma_50'] - df['sma_200']).abs() / df['Close'] * 100
    
    # Calculate normalized compression ratio
    df['ma_compression_ratio'] = df['ma_dist_8_21'] / df['ma_dist_50_200']
    
    # Identify extreme compression (bottom 10% of historical values)
    df['ma_compressed'] = (
        df['ma_compression_ratio'] < df['ma_compression_ratio'].rolling(252).quantile(0.1)
    ).astype(int)
    
    return df
```

### Integration Steps
1. Add the `_add_ma_compression` method to the `Features` class in `src/v2/features.py`
2. Call this method after moving averages are calculated in the `generate` method
3. Add the new features to the `keep_columns` list
4. Update documentation in `docs/features.md`

### Testing Approach
1. Verify calculations on sample data
2. Test on known compression/expansion examples:
   - Pre-breakout compression: NVDA (late 2022)
   - Strong trend expansion: AAPL (early 2023)
   - Prolonged consolidation: KO (mid-2023)
3. Validate breakout prediction capability
4. Check for NaN handling and edge cases
5. Assess computational performance (rolling quantile may be intensive)

## Expected Impact

### Model Performance
- Improved identification of potential breakout opportunities
- Better timing of entry signals
- Enhanced feature stability through regime context
- Potential reduction in false trend signals

### Prediction Quality
- Earlier detection of emerging trends
- Reduced exposure to false breakouts
- Better handling of consolidation periods
- Improved context for other technical indicators

### Feature Importance
- Expected importance of ma_compressed: 2-4%
- Expected importance of ma_compression_ratio: 1-3%
- May show higher importance during market transitions
- Likely to complement trend strength indicators

## Success Metrics
1. **Primary Metrics**
   - Feature stability score improvement
   - Cross-validation RÂ² maintained or improved
   - Improved performance during trend transitions

2. **Secondary Metrics**
   - Better identification of breakout opportunities
   - Reduced false signals during consolidation
   - Improved timing of trend-based predictions
   - Computational efficiency (processing time < 10% increase)
