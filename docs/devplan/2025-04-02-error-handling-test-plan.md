# Error Handling Improvements Test Plan

**Date**: 2025-04-02

## Overview

This test plan outlines the steps to verify that the error handling improvements work correctly and don't introduce any regressions.

## Test Environment

- Local development environment
- Sample portfolio data

## Test Cases

### 1. Logger Configuration

**Objective**: Verify that the logger configuration changes eliminate duplicate logs.

**Steps**:
1. Launch the application with `make portfolio`
2. Perform various actions (load portfolio, select positions, etc.)
3. Check the logs for duplicate messages

**Expected Result**:
- No duplicate log messages (no messages appearing both with and without the "folio:" prefix)
- Root logger messages should only appear for warnings and errors from third-party libraries

### 2. Expected States vs. Errors

**Objective**: Verify that expected states are not logged as errors.

**Steps**:
1. Launch the application with `make portfolio`
2. Check the logs for the "No row selected" message

**Expected Result**:
- The message should appear at the DEBUG level, not as an ERROR
- No "Row index out of range" error should appear during normal startup

### 3. Error Handling in Callbacks

**Objective**: Verify that the error handling decorators work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily modify one of the callback functions to raise an exception
2. Launch the application and trigger the callback
3. Check the logs for the error message and stack trace

**Expected Result**:
- The error should be logged with a stack trace
- The application should continue functioning (not crash)
- The default return value from the decorator should be used

### 4. Custom Exceptions

**Objective**: Verify that custom exceptions provide better context.

**Steps**:
1. Temporarily modify code to raise a custom exception (e.g., `StateError.invalid_row(100, 10)`)
2. Launch the application and trigger the exception
3. Check the logs for the error message

**Expected Result**:
- The error message should include the specific context (e.g., "Row index out of range: 100, groups length: 10")
- The error should be properly categorized based on the exception type

### 5. Helper Functions

**Objective**: Verify that the helper functions work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Launch the application with `make portfolio`
2. Click on a position's "Details" button
3. Check the logs for messages from the helper functions

**Expected Result**:
- The helper functions should be called and log appropriate messages
- The position details modal should open correctly

### 6. Application Functionality

**Objective**: Verify that all application functionality continues to work correctly.

**Steps**:
1. Launch the application with `make portfolio`
2. Test all major features:
   - Loading a portfolio
   - Filtering positions
   - Sorting positions
   - Viewing position details
   - Searching for positions

**Expected Result**:
- All features should work as before
- No new errors should appear in the logs

## Success Criteria

The test will be considered successful if:

1. No duplicate log messages appear
2. Expected states are not logged as errors
3. Error handling decorators work correctly
4. Custom exceptions provide better context
5. Helper functions work correctly
6. All application functionality continues to work correctly

## Notes

- If any issues are found, they should be documented and fixed before considering the implementation complete
- Pay special attention to any unexpected behavior or new errors that might be introduced by the changes
