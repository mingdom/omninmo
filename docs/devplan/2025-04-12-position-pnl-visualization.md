# Position P&L Visualization Development Plan

**Date: 2025-04-12**

## 1. Overview

This development plan outlines the implementation of P&L (Profit and Loss) visualization for position groups in the Folio application, with a particular focus on multi-leg options strategies. The feature will allow users to visualize the potential profit or loss of a position or group of related positions (such as multi-leg options strategies) across a range of underlying prices.

## 2. Feature Requirements

### 2.1 Core Requirements

1. Generate P&L graphs for:
   - Individual option positions
   - Multi-leg option strategies (e.g., spreads, straddles, iron condors)
   - Combined stock and option positions

2. Display P&L at different points:
   - Current date (immediate P&L)
   - At expiration (terminal P&L)
   - At user-selected dates between now and expiration

3. UI Integration:
   - Add a "P&L" button to position table rows
   - Display P&L graphs in a modal/popup
   - Allow toggling between different visualization modes

### 2.2 Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)

1. Volatility surface visualization
2. Greeks visualization across price ranges
3. Probability cones for price movement
4. Scenario analysis with custom parameters

## 3. Technology Evaluation

### 3.1 Core Financial Library: QuantLib

**Strengths for P&L Visualization:**
- Already integrated into our codebase for option pricing
- Provides accurate pricing for American options
- Can calculate option prices at different dates and underlying prices
- Supports all option Greeks for sensitivity analysis
- Industry-standard library with active maintenance
- Proven reliability for financial calculations

**Limitations:**
- No built-in visualization capabilities
- Requires custom code to generate P&L data points
- Complex API for some advanced features

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use QuantLib for the pricing engine
- Leverage our existing option pricing functions in `src/folio/options.py`
- Generate price points across a range of underlying prices
- Calculate P&L for each price point based on position details

### 3.2 Visualization Library: Plotly/Dash

**Strengths for P&L Visualization:**
- Already used in our application for charts
- Interactive visualizations with zoom, pan, and tooltips
- Supports multiple chart types (line, area, etc.)
- Responsive design works well in modals
- Well-maintained with active community support

**Implementation Approach:**
- Use Plotly for the visualization layer
- Leverage existing Dash components for the UI
- Create reusable chart components
- Implement modal popup for displaying P&L charts

### 3.3 Custom Implementation Considerations

**Benefits of Custom Implementation:**
- Full control over calculation logic
- No dependency on third-party libraries beyond QuantLib
- Can be tailored exactly to our needs
- Easier to maintain and extend over time
- Consistent with our existing codebase

**Implementation Challenges:**
- Need to handle various position types (stocks, options, multi-leg strategies)
- Must account for different evaluation dates
- Requires careful testing to ensure accuracy
- More initial development effort than using specialized libraries

## 4. Recommended Approach

### 4.1 Technology Stack

1. **Core Calculation Engine**: QuantLib (already integrated)
   - Use existing `calculate_bs_price` function in `src/folio/options.py`
   - Extend to calculate prices at different dates and underlying prices
   - Leverage for accurate American options pricing

2. **Data Generation**: Custom Python code
   - Create functions to generate P&L data points across price ranges
   - Support different dates (current, expiration, custom)
   - Handle both stock and option positions

3. **Visualization**: Plotly/Dash
   - Create interactive line charts for P&L visualization
   - Use existing Dash modal components for the popup UI
   - Consistent with our current UI framework

4. **Integration Approach**: Direct UI Integration
   - Implement UI components from the start
   - Use the UI for testing the feature
   - Avoid creating separate experimental scripts

### 4.2 Implementation Plan

1. Create a new module `src/folio/pnl.py` for P&L calculation functions
2. Create a new UI component `src/folio/components/pnl_chart.py` for the visualization
3. Add a P&L button to the position table
4. Implement the modal popup with the P&L chart
5. Register callbacks for the interactive features

```

### 5.3 Position Table Integration

Add a P&L button to the position table:

```python
# In src/folio/components/portfolio_table.py

def create_position_table(data):
    """Create the portfolio position table."""
    # Existing code...

    # Add P&L button to actions column
    actions = html.Div([
        # Existing buttons...
        html.Button(
            html.I(className="fas fa-chart-line"),

            className="btn btn-sm btn-outline-primary ms-1",
            title="View P&L Analysis",
        ),
    ])

    # Existing code...
```

### 5.4 Callback Integration

Register callbacks for the P&L modal and chart:

```python
# In src/folio/app.py or appropriate callback file

@app.callback(
    [
        Output("pnl-modal", "is_open"),
        Output("pnl-chart", "figure"),
        Output("pnl-position-details", "children"),
    ],
    [
        Input({"type": "position-pnl", "index": ALL}, "n_clicks"),
        Input("pnl-date-selector", "value"),
        Input("pnl-custom-date", "date"),
        Input("close-pnl-modal", "n_clicks"),
    ],
    [
        State("portfolio-data", "data"),
        State("pnl-modal", "is_open"),
    ],
)
def toggle_pnl_modal(btn_clicks, date_type, custom_date, close_clicks, portfolio_data, is_open):
    """Toggle P&L modal and update chart."""
    # Implementation details...
```

## 9. Assumptions and Open Questions

### 9.1 Assumptions

1. **User Needs**: We assume users primarily want to visualize P&L at current date and expiration, with custom dates being secondary.

2. **Data Availability**: We assume all necessary data (option prices, greeks, etc.) is already available in the system or can be calculated using existing functions.

3. **Performance Expectations**: We assume users are willing to wait 1-2 seconds for P&L calculations of complex strategies.

4. **Option Types**: We assume the focus is on standard American options, which are already supported by our QuantLib implementation.

5. **UI Integration**: We assume the modal pattern is appropriate and consistent with the rest of the application.

6. **Position Grouping**: We assume the system can already identify related positions (e.g., options on the same underlying).

### 9.2 Open Questions

1. **Volatility Assumptions**: Should we use current implied volatility for future dates, or implement a term structure?

2. **UI Controls**: What level of customization should users have for the P&L visualization (e.g., adjusting volatility, interest rates)?

3. **Performance Targets**: What is an acceptable calculation time for complex strategies? Should we implement caching?

4. **Error Handling**: How should we handle unsupported strategies or calculation errors in the UI?

5. **Expiration Handling**: How do we handle positions with different expiration dates in the same strategy?

6. **Data Persistence**: Should P&L calculations be saved between sessions or always calculated fresh?

7. **Testing Strategy**: Which specific multi-leg option positions should we focus on for initial testing?

8. **Calculation Accuracy**: How do we validate the accuracy of our P&L calculations for complex strategies?

5. **Real Portfolio Tests**:
   - Test with actual multi-leg SPY options from the portfolio
   - Verify calculations match expected P&L for known strategies
   - Compare with external calculators for validation

## 11. Conclusion

The P&L visualization feature will significantly enhance the Folio application by providing users with powerful tools to analyze the risk and reward profiles of their positions and strategies. By leveraging our existing QuantLib integration for pricing and Plotly/Dash for visualization, we can implement this feature efficiently while maintaining high accuracy in the calculations.

Our approach focuses on building a custom implementation that gives us full control over the calculation logic and visualization, rather than relying on third-party libraries that may not be actively maintained. This ensures long-term maintainability and allows us to tailor the feature exactly to our needs.

The implementation will support both stock and option positions, including multi-leg strategies like covered calls, which addresses a key requirement. By directly integrating with the UI from the start, we can use the interface itself for testing and validation, streamlining the development process.

The modular design allows for future enhancements such as volatility surface visualization and probability cones without significant refactoring. The implementation plan provides a clear roadmap for delivering this feature in manageable phases over a 4-6 week timeframe.

While there are some complexities and risks to consider, particularly around calculation accuracy and performance with complex strategies, these can be mitigated through careful implementation and thorough testing. The design trade-offs outlined in this plan aim to balance functionality, performance, and implementation complexity to deliver a valuable feature that enhances the user experience without introducing undue technical debt.
