feat(docker): Containerize Folio application with improved UX

This commit adds Docker containerization to the Folio application with
several improvements for better user experience:

- Create Dockerfile using Python 3.11 with all necessary dependencies
- Configure docker-compose.yml for easy deployment
- Fix module import issues by using relative imports
- Add support for --host parameter to bind to all interfaces
- Improve startup message to clearly show the correct access URL
- Add diagnostic scripts for troubleshooting Docker issues
- Document containerization process and issues in devlog

The application can now be run with:
```
make docker-compose-up
```
And accessed at http://localhost:8050

Resolves issues with NotRequired type and module imports in container
environment.
